AB We develop a conceptual framework for collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing, providing systematic guidance for how human marketers and consumers can team up with AI, which has profound implications for retailing, which is the interface between marketers and consumers. Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. Marketers should optimize the mix and timing of AI-HI marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between AI and HI strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years, AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India. The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called "Beyond AI". Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called "Brain Intelligence (BI)" that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial robots.

AB Nowadays, Industry 4.0 can be considered a reality, a paradigm integrating modern technologies and innovations. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered the leading component of the industrial transformation enabling intelligent machines to execute tasks autonomously such as self-monitoring, interpretation, diagnosis, and analysis. AI-based methodologies (especially machine learning and deep learning support manufacturers and industries in predicting their maintenance needs and reducing downtime. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) studies and designs approaches, algorithms and tools producing human-understandable explanations of AI-based systems information and decisions. This article presents a comprehensive survey of AI and XAI-based methods adopted in the Industry 4.0 scenario. First, we briefly discuss different technologies enabling Industry 4.0. Then, we present an in-depth investigation of the main methods used in the literature: we also provide the details of what, how, why, and where these methods have been applied for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, we illustrate the opportunities and challenges that elicit future research directions toward responsible or human-centric AI and XAI systems, essential for adopting high-stakes industry applications.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) service failures are inevitable in hospitality companies; thus, how AI service recovery retains customers is an issue that cannot be ignored. This article focuses on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional "intelligence quotient" thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response can increase customers' continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extends the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.

AB The medical field has seen a rapid increase in the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. With the introduction of such AI-based prediction model tools and software in cardiovascular patient care, the cardiovascular researcher and healthcare professional are challenged to understand the opportunities as well as the limitations of the AI-based predictions. In this article, we present 12 critical questions for cardiovascular health professionals to ask when confronted with an AI-based prediction model. We aim to support medical professionals to distinguish the AI-based prediction models that can add value to patient care from the AI that does not.

AB Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have become two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area. We also identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain technologies for AI.

AB The hospitality and tourism industry faces serious challenges during public health emergencies such as COVID19. Managers are concerned not only about how to maintain business and provide humanized services but also about social distancing. This study presented artificial intelligence (AI) technology-based service encounters as a possible solution and examined the antecedents and consequences of the encounter triad including customers, employees, and AI. Based on a systematic literature review, the study identified 4 modes of AI technology-based service encounters: AI-supplemented, AI-generated, AI-mediated, and AI-facilitated encounters. In addition, the study developed an integrated model to specify the factors that influence AI technology-infused service encounters in general and the customer service outcomes that result from the encounters. The findings contribute to service management and AI application theoretically and practically.

AB With the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the tourism and hospitality industry, the phenomenon of AI service failure emerges, which merits empirical attention. Via six scenario-based experiments, this study verifies why and how humorous responses from AI agents affect customers' tolerance of AI service failure. Findings confirm the positive impact of humorous response on customer tolerance. Results further reveal the mediating effects of perceived warmth and perceived competence along with boundaries (customer inoculation and time pressure) of the humor effect. These findings enhance knowledge of AI service failure and recovery by delineating the recovery effect of AI agents' humorous responses. This research also offers tourism companies a new tool, humorous response, for resolving AI service failures. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of ethical concerns surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an explosion of high-level ethical principles being published by a wide range of public and private organizations. However, there is a need to consider how AI developers can be practically assisted to anticipate, identify and address ethical issues regarding AI technologies. This is particularly important in the development of AI intended for healthcare settings, where applications will often interact directly with patients in various states of vulnerability. In this paper, we propose that an 'embedded ethics' approach, in which ethicists and developers together address ethical issues via an iterative and continuous process from the outset of development, could be an effective means of integrating robust ethical considerations into the practical development of medical AI.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for "lower" (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the "softer" intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.

AB The authors develop a three-stage framework for strategic marketing planning, incorporating multiple artificial intelligence (AI) benefits: mechanical AI for automating repetitive marketing functions and activities, thinking AI for processing data to arrive at decisions, and feeling AI for analyzing interactions and human emotions. This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI.

AB Along with the rapid developments in communication technologies and the surge in the use of mobile devices, a brand-new computation paradigm, edge computing, is surging in popularity. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence (AI) applications are thriving with the breakthroughs in deep learning and the many improvements in hardware architectures. Billions of data bytes, generated at the network edge, put massive demands on data processing and structural optimization. Thus, there exists a strong demand to integrate edge computing and AI, which gives birth to edge intelligence. In this article, we divide edge intelligence into AI for edge (intelligence-enabled edge computing) and AI on edge (artificial intelligence on edge). The former focuses on providing more optimal solutions to key problems in edge computing with the help of popular and effective AI technologies while the latter studies how to carry out the entire process of building AI models, i.e., model training and inference, on the edge. This article provides insights into this new interdisciplinary field from a broader perspective. It discusses the core concepts and the research roadmap, which should provide the necessary background for potential future research initiatives in edge intelligence.

AB The effects of the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), a general-purpose technology, on firm performance is an emerging and crucial issue. This study examines the impact of AI technology on firms' productivity and employee profiles. We use the keyword-matching method to parse the text of Taiwan patent grants, and obtain matched firm-level data on AI innovations in Taiwan's electronics industry for the 2002-2018 period. Empirical estimations indicate that AI technology is positively associated with productivity and employment. Meanwhile, non-AI patents also generate pro-productivity and pro-employment effects with a magnitude similar to that of AI technology. Inventing AI technologies crucially alters firms' workforce compositions, which reduce the share of labor force with educational qualifications of college level and below. Robustness checks reaffirm these findings.

SO NATURE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; SYSTEM; STATEMENT; QUALITY; PREDICTION; CANCER
AB The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.

AB Statistical learners are leading towards auto-epistemic logic, but is it the right way to progress in artificial intelligence (AI)? Ways to discover AI fit the senses and the intellect. The structure of symbols-the operations by which the intellectual solution is realized-and the search for strategic reference points evoke essential issues in the analysis of AI. Studying how knowledge can be represented through methods of theoretical generalization and empirical observation is only the latest step in a long process of evolution. In this paper, we try to outline the origin of knowledge and how modern artificial minds have inherited it.

AB In the future, artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to substantially change both marketing strategies and customer behaviors. Building from not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of AI involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI is embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single framework. Next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to privacy, bias and ethics. Finally, the authors suggest AI will be more effective if it augments (rather than replaces) human managers.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) reshapes companies and how innovation management is organized. Consistent with rapid technological development and the replacement of human organization, AI may indeed compel management to rethink a company's entire innovation process. In response, we review and explore the implications for future innovation management. Using ideas from the Carnegie School and the behavioral theory of the firm, we review the implications for innovation management of AI technologies and machine learning-based AI systems. We outline a framework showing the extent to which AI can replace humans and explain what is important to consider in making the transformation to the digital organization of innovation. We conclude our study by exploring directions for future research.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted by organizations, yet implementation is often carried out without careful consideration of the employees who will be working along with it. If employees do not un-derstand or work with AI, it is unlikely to bring value to an organization. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ways in which employees and AI can collaborate to build different levels of sociotechnical capital. Accordingly, we develop a model of AI integration based on Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory that combines AI novelty and scope dimensions. We take an organizational socialization approach to build an understanding of the process of integrating AI into the organization. Our framework underscores the importance of AI socialization as a core process in successfully integrating AI systems and employees. We conclude with a future research agenda that highlights the cognitive, relational, and structural implications of integrating AI and employees.

ID BLACK-BOX
AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in medicine. However, explainability issues make AI applications in clinical usages difficult. Some research has been conducted into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to overcome the limitation of the black-box nature of AI methods. Compared with AI techniques such as deep learning, XAI can provide both decision-making and explanations of the model. In this review, we conducted a survey of the recent trends in medical diagnosis and surgical applications using XAI. We have searched articles published between 2019 and 2021 from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery, and Google Scholar. We included articles which met the selection criteria in the review and then extracted and analyzed relevant information from the studies. Additionally, we provide an experimental showcase on breast cancer diagnosis, and illustrate how XAI can be applied in medical XAI applications. Finally, we summarize the XAI methods utilized in the medical XAI applications, the challenges that the researchers have met, and discuss the future research directions. The survey result indicates that medical XAI is a promising research direction, and this study aims to serve as a reference to medical experts and AI scientists when designing medical XAI applications.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly put into use to address cities' economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges. Thanks to its advanced capabilities, AI is set to become one of local governments' principal means of achieving smart and sustainable development. AI utilisation for urban planning, nonetheless, is a relatively understudied area of research, particularly in terms of the gap between theory and practice. This study presents a comprehensive review of the areas of urban planning in which AI technologies are contemplated or applied, and it is analysed how AI technologies support or could potentially support smart and sustainable development. Regarding the methodological approach, this is a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. The obtained insights include: (a) Early adopters' real-world AI applications in urban planning are paving the way to wider local government AI adoption; (b) Achieving wider AI adoption for urban planning involves collaboration and partnership between key stakeholders; (c) Big data is an integral element for effective AI utilisation in urban planning, and; (d) Convergence of artificial and human intelligence is crucial to address urbanisation issues adequately and to achieve smart and sustainable development. These insights highlight the importance of making planning smarter through advanced data and analytical methods.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the medical industry in the decade. It is critical to integrate human-computer interaction into daily clinic service and further increase the public acceptance of medical AI. Based on self-categorization theory, our research draws on speciesism as a vital cognitive factor to examine how patients' speciesism affects their acceptance of medical AI in different roles. The study adopted a positivist research paradigm by examining 249 samples of data collected during COVID-19 in China. The results indicate that patients with higher speciesism tend to have lower acceptance of medical AI in an independent role but higher acceptance in an assistive role. Furthermore, we verified the mediating effect of human-computer trust and the positive moderating role of human uniqueness perception. This article expands the practicality of speciesism from human-animal relationships into human-AI relationships and contributes to human-computer interaction from the perspective of medical AI acceptance.

AB This article develops a strategic framework for using artificial intelligence (AI) to engage customers for different service benefits. This framework lays out guidelines of how to use different AIs to engage customers based on considerations of nature of service task, service offering, service strategy, and service process. AI develops from mechanical, to thinking, and to feeling. As AI advances to a higher intelligence level, more human service employees and human intelligence (HI) at the intelligence levels lower than that level should be used less. Thus, at the current level of AI development, mechanical service should be performed mostly by mechanical AI, thinking service by both thinking AI and HI, and feeling service mostly by HI. Mechanical AI should be used for standardization when service is routine and transactional, for cost leadership, and mostly at the service delivery stage. Thinking AI should be used for personalization when service is data-rich and utilitarian, for quality leadership, and mostly at the service creation stage. Feeling AI should be used for relationalization when service is relational and high touch, for relationship leadership, and mostly at the service interaction stage. We illustrate various AI applications for the three major AI benefits, providing managerial guidelines for service providers to leverage the advantages of AI as well as future research implications for service researchers to investigate AI in service from modeling, consumer, and policy perspectives.

AB The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. This study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning AI in health and medicine. A total of 27,451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.6% were dated 2008-2018) were retrieved from the Web of Science platform. The descriptive analysis examined the publication volume, and authors and countries collaboration. A global network of authors' keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including Robotic, Machine learning, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Natural language process, and their most frequent applications in Clinical Prediction and Treatment. The number of cancer-related publications was the highest, followed by Heart Diseases and Stroke, Vision impairment, Alzheimer's, and Depression. Moreover, the shortage in the research of AI application to some high burden diseases suggests future directions in AI research. This study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and suggests the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical AI products.

AB The potential privacy issues associated with artificial intelligence (AI) in service delivery require careful attention but remain understudied. Through the lens of the watching-eye effect, this research examines the impact of AI on customers' uneasiness through the mediation of privacy concerns. Study 1 confirms the watching "camera eye" effect of AI devices. Moreover, it identifies the service setting as a contextual boundary condition, wherein this effect holds in a private setting but not in a public setting. Study 2 further indicates that when there is a built-in camera, the "physical eye" in an AI device matters; humanoid AI devices trigger stronger privacy concerns than nonhumanoid AI devices and tablets, leading to greater uneasiness. This impact affects both genders but is more pronounced among women. This research extends the AI literature in service and business ethics and offers insight into managing personal information and privacy issues effectively.

AB Lack of trust is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of taking full advantage of the benefits artificial intelligence (AI) has to offer. Most research on trust in AI focuses on cognitive ways to boost trust. Here, instead, we focus on boosting trust in AI via affective means. Specifically, we tested and found associations between one's attachment style-an individual difference representing the way people feel, think, and behave in relationships-and trust in AI. In Study 1 we found that attachment anxiety predicted less trust. In Study 2, we found that enhancing attachment anxiety reduced trust, whereas enhancing attachment security increased trust in AI. In Study 3, we found that exposure to attachment security cues (but not positive affect cues) resulted in increased trust as compared with exposure to neutral cues. Overall, our findings demonstrate an association between attachment security and trust in AI, and support the ability to increase trust in AI via attachment security priming.

AB The development of digital pathology and progression of state-of-the-art algorithms for computer vision have led to increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL)-based AI, in tumor pathology. The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements. Herein, we present an overview on how AI-based approaches could be integrated into the workflow of pathologists and discuss the challenges and perspectives of the implementation of AI in tumor pathology.

AB As the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving aspects of healthcare delivery is increasingly becoming evident, it becomes likely that AI will be incorporated in routine clinical care in the near future. This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care. In this article, we propose a governance model that aims to not only address the ethical and regulatory issues that arise out of the application of AI in health care, but also stimulate further discussion about governance of AI in health care.

AB Service robots are taking over the frontline. They can possess three types of artificial intelligence (AI): mechanical, thinking, and feeling AI. Although these intelligences determine how service robots can help customers, not much is known about how customers respond to robots of different intelligence. This paper addresses this gap, builds on the appraisal theory of emotions, and employs three online experiments and one field study to demonstrate that customers have different emotional responses to the three types of AI. Particularly, the influence of AI on positive emotions becomes stronger as the AI type becomes more sophisticated. That is, feeling AI relates more strongly to positive emotions than mechanical AI. Also, feeling AI and thinking AI increase spending and loyalty intention through customers' positive emotions. We also identify important contingency effects of service tiers: mechanical AI is more suitable for low-cost firms, whereas feeling AI mainly benefits full-service providers. Remarkably, none of the three intelligences are directly related to negative emotions; perceived robot autonomy is an important mediator in these relationships. The findings yield concrete managerial guidance as to how smart a service robot should be by pinpointing the right type of AI given the market segment of the service provider.

ID AI; UNEMPLOYMENT; YOUNG; LIFE
AB While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions in healthcare, it also poses a number of threats to human health and well-being via social, political, economic and security-related determinants of health. We describe three such main ways misused narrow AI serves as a threat to human health: through increasing opportunities for control and manipulation of people; enhancing and dehumanising lethal weapon capacity and by rendering human labour increasingly obsolescent. We then examine self-improving 'artificial general intelligence' (AGI) and how this could pose an existential threat to humanity itself. Finally, we discuss the critical need for effective regulation, including the prohibition of certain types and applications of AI, and echo calls for a moratorium on the development of self-improving AGI. We ask the medical and public health community to engage in evidence-based advocacy for safe AI, rooted in the precautionary principle.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the core drivers of industrial development and a critical factor in promoting the integration of emerging technologies, such as graphic processing unit, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and the blockchain, in the new generation of big data and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we construct an extensive survey over the period 1961-2018 of AI and deep learning. The research provides a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners through the multi-angle systematic analysis of AI, from underlying mechanisms to practical applications, from fundamental algorithms to industrial achievements, from current status to future trends. Although there exist many issues toward AI, it is undoubtful that AI has become an innovative and revolutionary assistant in a wide range of applications and fields.

AB The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders), and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.

AB Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery plays a significant role for the reliability and safety of modern industrial systems. As an emerging field in industrial applications and an effective solution for fault recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry. However, great challenges are met by the AI methods under the different real operating conditions. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of AI algorithms in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, from both the views of theory background and industrial applications. A brief introduction of different AI algorithms is presented first, including the following methods: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support vector machine, artificial neural network and deep learning. Then, a broad literature survey of these AI algorithms in industrial applications is given. Finally, the advantages, limitations, practical implications of different AI algorithms, as well as some new research trends, are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatry has risen over the past several years to meet the growing need for improved access to mental health solutions. Additionally, shortages of mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to exacerbate the burden of mental illness worldwide. AI applications already in existence include those enabled to assist with psychiatric diagnoses, symptom tracking, disease course prediction, and psychoeducation. Modalities of AI mental health care delivery include availability through the internet, smartphone applications, and digital gaming Here we review emerging AI-based interventions in the form of chat and therapy bots, specifically conversational applications that teach the user emotional coping mechanisms and provide support for people with communication difficulties, computer generated images of faces that form the basis of avatar therapy, and intelligent animal-like robots with new advances in digital psychiatry. We discuss the implications of incorporating AI chatbots into clinical practice and offer perspectives on how these AI-based interventions will further impact the field of psychiatry.

AB In recent years, Earth system sciences are urgently calling for innovation on improving accuracy, enhancing model intelligence level, scaling up operation, and reducing costs in many subdomains amid the exponentially accumulated datasets and the promising artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in computer science. This paper presents work led by the NASA Earth Science Data Systems Working Groups and ESIP machine learning cluster to give a comprehensive overview of AI in Earth sciences. It holistically introduces the current status, technology, use cases, challenges, and opportunities, and provides all the levels of AI practitioners in geosciences with an overall big picture and to "blow away the fog to get a clearer vision" about the future development of Earth AI. The paper covers all the majorspheres in the Earth system and investigates representative AI research in each domain. Widely used AI algorithms and computing cyberinfrastructure are briefly introduced. The mandatory steps in a typical workflow of specializing AI to solve Earth scientific problems are decomposed and analyzed. Eventually, it concludes with the grand challenges and reveals the opportunities to give some guidance and pre-warnings on allocating resources wisely to achieve the ambitious Earth AI goals in the future.

AB The latest 5G mobile networks have enabled many exciting Internet of Things (IoT) applications that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones). The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows). As guidance for researchers and practitioners, this article also explores UAV-based edge AI implementation challenges, lessons learned, and future research directions.

AB This paper analyses the link between the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and innovation performance in firms. Based on firm-level data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2018, we examine the role of different AI methods and application areas in innovation. The results show that 5.8% of firms in Germany were actively using AI in their business operations or products and services in 2019. We find that the use of AI is associated with annual sales with world-first product innovations in these firms of about (sic)16 billion (i.e. 18% of total annual sales of world-first innovations). In addition, AI technologies have been used in process innovation that contributed to about 6% of total annual cost savings of the German business sector. Firms that apply AI broadly (using different methods for different applications areas) and that have already several years of experience in using AI obtain significantly higher innovation results. These positive findings on the role of AI for innovation have to be interpreted with caution as they refer to a specific country (Germany) in a situation where AI started to diffuse rapidly.

AB This paper seeks to identify the contributions of artificial intelligence (AI) to supply chain management (SCM) through a systematic review of the existing literature. To address the current scientific gap of AI in SCM, this study aimed to determine the current and potential AI techniques that can enhance both the study and practice of SCM. Gaps in the literature that need to be addressed through scientific research were also identified. More specifically, the following four aspects were covered: (1) the most prevalent AI techniques in SCM; (2) the po-tential AI techniques for employment in SCM; (3) the current AI-improved SCM subfields; and (4) the subfields that have high potential to be enhanced by AI. A specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify and examine papers from four SCM fields: logistics, marketing, supply chain and production. This paper provides insights through systematic analysis and synthesis.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been in existence for over six decades and has experienced AI winters and springs. The rise of super computing power and Big Data technologies appear to have empowered AI in recent years. The new generation of AI is rapidly expanding and has again become an attractive topic for research. This paper aims to identify the challenges associated with the use and impact of revitalised AI based systems for decision making and offer a set of research propositions for information systems (IS) researchers. The paper first provides a view of the history of AI through the relevant papers published in the International Journal of Information Management (IJIM). It then discusses AI for decision making in general and the specific issues regarding the interaction and integration of AI to support or replace human decision makers in particular. To advance research on the use of AI for decision making in the era of Big Data, the paper offers twelve research propositions for IS researchers in terms of conceptual and theoretical development, AI technology-human interaction, and AI implementation.

AB The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers exciting opportunities for marketing practice and academic research. In this study, through the application of natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical algorithms, we examine extant literature in terms of its dominant topics, diversity, evolution over time, and dynamics to map the existing knowledge base. Ten salient research themes emerge: (1) understanding consumer sentiments, (2) industrial opportunities of AI, (3) analyzing customer satisfaction, (4) electronic wordof-mouth-based insights, (5) improving market performance, (6) using AI for brand management, (7) measuring and enhancing customer loyalty and trust, (8) AI and novel services, (9) using AI to improve customer relationships, and (10) AI and strategic marketing. The scientometric analyses reveal key concepts, keyword cooccurrences, authorship networks, top research themes, landmark publications, and the evolution of the research field over time. With the insights as a foundation, this article closes with a proposed agenda for further research.

First, an assessment based on 26 articles on this topic reveals much exploratory, conceptual, qualitative, and practice-driven research in studies reflecting the increasing complexities of using AI in government - and the resulting implications, opportunities, and risks thereof for public governance. Second, based on both the literature review and the analysis of articles included in this special issue, we propose a research agenda comprising eight process-related recommendations and seven content-related recommendations. Process-wise, future research on the implications of the use of AI for public governance should move towards more public sector-focused, empirical, multidisciplinary, and explanatory research while focusing more on specific forms of AI rather than AI in general. Content-wise, our research agenda calls for the development of solid, multidisciplinary, theoretical foundations for the use of AI for public governance, as well as investigations of effective implementation, engagement, and communication plans for government strategies on AI use in the public sector. Finally, the research agenda calls for research into managing the risks of AI use in the public sector, governance modes possible for AI use in the public sector, performance and impact measurement of AI use in government, and impact evaluation of scaling-up AI usage in the public sector.

AB Despite heightened interest, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into businesses remains challenging. Recent surveys show that up to 85 % of AI initiatives ultimately fail to deliver on their promises. Studies on successful AI applications that could provide invaluable lessons for organizations embarking on their AI journey are still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to understand how AI technology, people, and processes should be managed to successfully create value. Building on the resource orchestration perspective, this study analyzes the successful applications of AI at Alibaba's e-commerce fulfillment center. The findings indicate that the key AI resources include data, AI algorithms, and robots. These resources must be orchestrated (e.g., coordinated, leveraged, deployed) to work with other related resources, such as warehouse facilities and existing information systems, to generate strong AI capabilities. The key AI capabilities generated include forecasting, planning, and learning. More importantly, AI capabilities are not independent - they interact and coevolve with human capabilities to create business value in terms of efficiency (e.g., space optimization, labor productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., error reduction). The implications of understanding these social informatics of AI for research and practice are discussed.

AB The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last 60 years. While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the provision of healthcare services in resource-poor settings. Many health system hurdles in such settings could be overcome with the use of AI and other complementary emerging technologies. Further research and investments in the development of AI tools tailored to resource-poor settings will accelerate realising of the full potential of AI for improving global health.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising the way customers interact with brands. There is a lack of empirical research into AI-enabled customer experiences. Hence, this study aims to analyse how the integration of AI in shopping can lead to an improved AI-enabled customer experience. We propose a theoretical model drawing on the trust-commitment theory and service quality model. An online survey was distributed to customers who have used an AI- enabled service offered by a beauty brand. A total of 434 responses were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings indicate the significant role of trust and perceived sacrifice as factors mediating the effects of perceived convenience, personalisation and AI-enabled service quality. The findings also reveal the significant effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. This study contributes to the existing literature by revealing the mediating effects of trust and perceived sacrifice and the direct effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. In addition, the study has practical implications for retailers deploying AI in services offered to their customers.

AB PurposeThis study explores features that impact consumers' purchase intention through artificial intelligence (AI), because it is believed that through artificial intelligence, consumers' intention to purchase grows significantly, especially in the retail sector, whereby retailers provide lucrative offers to motivate consumers. The study develops a theoretical framework based on media-richness theory to investigate the role of perceived anthropomorphism toward an intention to purchase products using AI.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on cross-sectional data through an online survey. The data have been analyzed using PLS-SEM and SPSS PROCESS macro.FindingsThe results show that consumers tend to demand anthropomorphized products to gain a better shopping experience and, therefore, demand features that attract and motivate them to purchase through artificial intelligence via mediating variables, such as perceived animacy and perceived intelligence. Moreover, trust in artificial intelligence moderates the relationship between perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy.Originality/valueThe study investigates and concludes with managerial and academic insights into consumer purchase intention through artificial intelligence in the retail and marketing sector.

AB The practice of medicine is changing with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to replace the traditional physician-patient relationship.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a "good AI society" has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a "good AI society". Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a "good AI society." The research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.

We discuss the origin of AI, progress to machine learning, and then discuss how the limits of machine learning lead data scientists to develop artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms through biomimicry. We will place all these technologies in the context of practical clinical examples and show how AI can act as a tool to support and amplify human cognitive functions for physicians delivering care to increasingly complex patients. The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the fundamentals of AI. Its purpose is to demystify this technology for practicing surgeons so they can better understand how and where to apply it. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data, perceiving complex environments from these data, and then making smart decisions in a timely manner are difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is now a proven success in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.

ID INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS
AB The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform business practices and industries and has the potential to address major societal problems, including sustainability. Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sus- tainability.

AB Currently, with the rapid development of science and technology, the field of artificial intelligence presents characteristics such as a wide crossover of disciplines and fast update, and the field of artificial intelligence has become a new focus of international competition. As an interdisciplinary field, the field of artificial intelligence has rich knowledge and strategic management significance. This article conducts an in-depth study on the knowledge structure and evolution trends in the field of AI, and the main work is as follows. First, a new potential feature topic model New-LDA is proposed for the study of topic recognition, which enhances the feature learning ability of the traditional LDA model, and makes up for the deficiency of the traditional LDA model in the ability of recognizing topics in complex environments. Second, the knowledge structure in the field of AI is analyzed from two aspects: topic recognition and coword analysis. The time series model is introduced to establish the topic evolution network, and the high-frequency words in three periods are compared and analyzed to find the evolution regular of knowledge structure in the AI domain. Finally, taking the cross-discipline of AI as an example, the thematic evolution of the field and its cross-discipline is analyzed to determine the future development direction and evolutionary trend of the field of AI.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have multiplied our capabilities to extract quantitative information from digital histopathology images. AI is expected to reduce workload for human experts, improve the objectivity and consistency of pathology reports, and have a clinical impact by extracting hidden information from routinely available data. Here, we describe how AI can be used to predict cancer outcome, treatment response, genetic alterations and gene expression from digitized histopathology slides. We summarize the underlying technologies and emerging approaches, noting limitations, including the need for data sharing and standards. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of AI in cancer research and oncology.
   Schmatko et al. review the application of artificial intelligence to digitized histopathology for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and classification and discuss its potential utility in the clinic and broader implications for cancer research and care.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations' investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.

AB In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.

AB Objectives: The number of studies employing artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine and deep learning, is growing fast. The majority of studies suffer from limitations in planning, conduct and reporting, resulting in low robustness, reproducibility and applicability. We here present a consented checklist on planning, conducting and reporting of AI studies for authors, reviewers and readers in dental research.
   Methods: Lending from existing reviews, standards and other guidance documents, an initial draft of the checklist and an explanatory document were derived and discussed among the members of IADR's e-oral network and the ITU/WHO focus group "Artificial Intelligence for Health (AI4H)". The checklist was consented by 27 group members via an e-Delphi process.
   Results: Thirty-one items on planning, conducting and reporting of AI studies were agreed on. These involve items on the studies' wider goal, focus, design and specific aims, data sampling and reporting, sample estimation, reference test construction, model parameters, training and evaluation, uncertainty and explainability, performance metrics and data partitions.
   Conclusion: Authors, reviewers and readers should consider this checklist when planning, conducting, reporting and evaluating studies on AI in dentistry.
   Clinical significance: Current studies on AI in dentistry show considerable weaknesses, hampering their replication and application. This checklist may help to overcome this issue and advance AI research as well as facilitate a debate on standards in this fields.

AB The energy consumption structure is now shifting from using fossil fuels to using renewable energy. Thus it is crucial to research if decreasing energy use can genuinely boost green total factor productivity (GTFP) and how to reconcile the link between reducing energy consumption and GTFP using various technical approaches. This study proposes the two-way influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural resources market on GTFP. It comprehensively evaluates the effects of AI on green economic development using the instance of China and a pertinent mathematical model. We found that the impacts of AI on carbon intensity vary between industries and developmental phases. Compared to the 11th Five-Year Plan, AI significantly reduced carbon intensity during the 12th. Compared to capital-intensive businesses, labor- and technology-intensive industries likely have a more significant drop in carbon intensity due to AI and natural resources market.

AB Current advances in research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse on AI ethics. In consequence, a number of ethics guidelines have been released in recent years. These guidelines comprise normative principles and recommendations aimed to harness the "disruptive" potentials of new AI technologies. Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics. Finally, I also examine to what extent the respective ethical principles and values are implemented in the practice of research, development and application of AI systems-and how the effectiveness in the demands of AI ethics can be improved.

AB Simple Summary In the present review, an up-to-date summary of the state of the art of artificial intelligence (AI) implementation for thyroid nodule characterization and cancer is provided. The opinion on the real effectiveness of AI systems remains controversial. Taking into consideration the largest and most scientifically valid studies, it is possible to state that AI provides results that are comparable or inferior to expert ultrasound specialists and radiologists. Promising data approve AI as a support tool and simultaneously highlight the need for a radiologist supervisory framework for AI provided results. Therefore, current solutions might be more suitable for educational purposes. Machine learning (ML) is an interdisciplinary sector in the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that creates systems to set up logical connections using algorithms, and thus offers predictions for complex data analysis. In the present review, an up-to-date summary of the current state of the art regarding ML and AI implementation for thyroid nodule ultrasound characterization and cancer is provided, highlighting controversies over AI application as well as possible benefits of ML, such as, for example, training purposes. There is evidence that AI increases diagnostic accuracy and significantly limits inter-observer variability by using standardized mathematical algorithms. It could also be of aid in practice settings with limited sub-specialty expertise, offering a second opinion by means of radiomics and computer-assisted diagnosis. The introduction of AI represents a revolutionary event in thyroid nodule evaluation, but key issues for further implementation include integration with radiologist expertise, impact on workflow and efficiency, and performance monitoring.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving set of technologies used for solving a wide range of applied issues. The core of AI is machine learning (ML)-a complex of algorithms and methods that address the problems of classification, clustering, and forecasting. The practical application of AI&ML holds promising prospects. Therefore, the researches in this area are intensive. However, the industrial applications of AI and its more intensive use in society are not widespread at the present time. The challenges of widespread AI applications need to be considered from both the AI (internal problems) and the societal (external problems) perspective. This consideration will identify the priority steps for more intensive practical application of AI technologies, their introduction, and involvement in industry and society. The article presents the identification and discussion of the challenges of the employment of AI technologies in the economy and society of resource-based countries. The systematization of AI&ML technologies is implemented based on publications in these areas. This systematization allows for the specification of the organizational, personnel, social and technological limitations. This paper outlines the directions of studies in AI and ML, which will allow us to overcome some of the limitations and achieve expansion of the scope of AI&ML applications.

AB The nascent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public sector is being assessed in contradictory ways. But while there is increasing speculation about both its dangers and its benefits, there is very little empirical research to substantiate them. This study aims at mapping the challenges in the adoption of AI in the public sector as perceived by key stakeholders. Drawing on the theoretical lens of framing, we analyse a case of adoption of the AI system IBM Watson in public healthcare in China, to map how three groups of stakeholders (government policy-makers, hospital managers/doctors, and Information Technology (IT) firm managers) perceive the challenges of AI adoption in the public sector. Findings show that different stakeholders have diverse, and sometimes contradictory, framings of the challenges. We contribute to research by providing an empirical basis to claims of AI challenges in the public sector, and to practice by providing four sets of guidelines for the governance of AI adoption in the public sector.

AB Despite the exponential growth in the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), our knowledge on the public perception of AI, especially in the context of local government services, is still limited. To bridge this gap, this study aims to provide empirical evidence and insights into public perceptions concerning the use of AI in local government services. Our methodological approach involves collecting data via an online survey from the residents of three major Australian cities-i.e., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane-and Hong Kong (n = 850), and performing statistical analyses. We found that: (a) Ease of using AI is significantly and positively influenced by attitude towards AI; (b) Attitude towards AI significantly and positively influences perceived usefulness of AI in local government services; (c) AI is seen useful in resource management and to improve delivery of service, reduction of cost to provide urban-service, improvement of public safety, and monitoring the effectiveness of strategies to manage environmental crisis, and; (d) AI is more positively perceived by Australians in comparison to Hong Kongers, indicating the impact of contextual and cultural differences. The research findings inform local government authorities-e.g., urban policymakers, managers, and planners-on their AI policy, planning and implementation decisions.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A-3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers' unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.

AB Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.

AB The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its progressively wider impact on many sectors requires an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects. The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) offers businesses a way to save expenses and a fundamental shift in innovation tools in the digital era. Whether AI can improve corporate innovation efficiency has been hotly discussed, but there is little empirical evidence. We use text mining to construct a firm-level AI application index innovatively. We investigate how AI affects corporate innovation efficiency using panel data from 3185 listed companies between 2008 and 2020. The results show that AI application significantly improves corporate innovation efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid endogeneity problems, we use instrumental variables and propensity score matching (PSM) to test and obtain consistent conclusions. Further, we find that intensifying external market competition and flattening internal organizational structure, which are the important economic forms of innovation resource reallocation, play a moderating effect. Furthermore, the impact of AI on corporate innovation efficiency is enormous in companies with a more extensive size and less management power. In addition, the higher the level of AI development in the industry and region where the enterprise is located, the stronger the impact of AI on corporate innovation efficiency. This paper provides micro evidence for the innovation effects of AI.

AB To obtain benefits in the provision of public services, managers of public organizations have considerably increased the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, research on AI is still scarce, and the advance of this technology in the public sector, as well as the applications and results of this strategy, need to be systematized. With this goal in mind, this paper examines research related to AI as applied to the public sector. A review of the literature covering articles available in five research databases was completed using the PRISMA protocol for literature reviews. The search process yielded 59 articles within the scope of the study out of a total of 1682 studies. Results show a growing trend of interest in AI in the public sector, with India and the US as the most active countries. General public service, economic affairs, and environmental protection are the functions of government with the most studies related to AI. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) technique is the most recurrent in the investigated studies and was pointed out as a technique that provides positive results in several areas of its application. A research framework for AI solutions for the public sector is presented, where it is demonstrated that policies and ethical implications of the use of AI permeate all layers of application of this technology and the solutions can generate value for functions of government. However, for this, a prior debate with society about the use of AI in the public sector is recommended.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming an integral part of the digital strategy of organizations. Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors - i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities.

AB How will superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) affect human decision-making? And what will be the mechanisms behind this effect? We address these questions in a domain where AI already exceeds human performance, analyzing more than 5.8 million move decisions made by professional Go players over the past 71 y (1950 to 2021). To address the first question, we use a superhuman AI program to estimate the quality of human decisions across time, generating 58 billion counterfactual game patterns and comparing the win rates of actual human decisions with those of counterfactual AI decisions. We find that humans began to make significantly better decisions following the advent of superhuman AI. We then examine human players' strategies across time and find that novel decisions (i.e., previously unobserved moves) occurred more frequently and became associated with higher decision quality after the advent of superhuman AI. Our findings suggest that the development of superhuman AI programs may have prompted human players to break away from traditional strategies and induced them to explore novel moves, which in turn may have improved their decision-making.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on technological innovation through logic reasoning and empirical modeling. Based on the industrial robot data provided by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the panel data of China's 14 manufacturing sectors from 2008 to 2017, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of AI on technological innovation. Our analysis shows that the mechanism of how AI affects technological innovation is that the former promotes technological innovation through accelerating knowledge creation and technology spillover, improving learning and absorptive capacities, while increasing R&D and talent investment. Our empirical results indicate that under the condition of controlling intensity of R&D investment, FDI, ownership structure, technical imitation, AI significantly promotes technological innovation. And the impact of AI on technological innovation experiences sector heterogeneity: AI has more significant impact on the technological innovation of low-tech sectors. The higher the level of AI, the greater its impact on technological innovation. Based on our established conclusions, we provide corresponding suggestions and recommendations for managerial decision-making.

ID SYSTEM; PREDICTION; STATEMENT; CANCER
AB The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.

AB The capability of AI is currently expanding beyond mechanical and repetitive to analytical and thinking. A "Feeling Economy" is emerging, in which AI performs many of the analytical and thinking tasks, and human workers gravitate more toward interpersonal and empathetic tasks. Although these people-focused tasks have always been important to jobs, they are now becoming more important to an unprecedented degree. To manage more effectively in the Feeling Economy, managers must adapt the nature of jobs to compensate for the fact that many of the analytical and thinking tasks are increasingly being performed by AI, and, thus, human workers must place increased emphasis on the empathetic and emotional dimensions of their work.

AB The growth of the construction industry is severely limited by the myriad complex challenges it faces such as cost and time overruns, health and safety, productivity and labour shortages. Also, construction industry is one the least digitized industries in the world, which has made it difficult for it to tackle the problems it currently faces. An advanced digital technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), is currently revolutionising industries such as manufacturing, retail, and telecommunications. The subfields of AI such as machine learning, knowledge-based systems, computer vision, robotics and optimisation have successfully been applied in other industries to achieve increased profitability, efficiency, safety and security. While acknowledging the benefits of AI applications, numerous challenges which are relevant to AI still exist in the construction industry. This study aims to unravel AI applications, examine AI techniques being used and identify opportunites and challenges for AI applications in the construction industry. A critical review of available literature on AI applications in the construction industry such as activity monitoring, risk management, resource and waste optimisation was conducted. Furthermore, the opportunities and challenges of AI applications in construction were identified and presented in this study. This study provides insights into key AI applications as it applies to construction-specific challenges, as well as the pathway to realise the acrueable benefits of AI in the construction industry.

TI The role of explainability in creating trustworthy artificial

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to improve the health and well-being of people, but adoption in clinical practice is still limited. Lack of transparency is identified as one of the main barriers to implementation, as clinicians should be confident the AI system can be trusted. Explainable AI has the potential to overcome this issue and can be a step towards trustworthy AI. In this paper we review the recent literature to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners on the design of explainable AI systems for the health-care domain and contribute to formalization of the field of explainable AI. We argue the reason to demand explainability determines what should be explained as this determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability (i.e. interpretability and fidelity). Based on this, we propose a framework to guide the choice between classes of explainable AI methods (explainable modelling versus post-hoc explanation; model-based, attribution-based, or example-based explanations; global and local explanations). Furthermore, we find that quantitative evaluation metrics, which are important for objective standardized evaluation, are still lacking for some properties (e.g. clarity) and types of explanations (e.g. example-based methods). We conclude that explainable modelling can contribute to trustworthy AI, but the benefits of explainability still need to be proven in practice and complementary measures might be needed to create trustworthy AI in health care (e.g. reporting data quality, performing extensive (external) validation, and regulation).

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. However, the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of high-quality data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of the limitations of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits, challenges, and drawbacks of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible strategies and approaches for overcoming the present obstacles are proposed. The use of data augmentation, explainable AI, and the integration of AI with traditional experimental methods, as well as the potential advantages of AI in pharmaceutical research, are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the potential of AI in drug discovery and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for realizing its potential in this field. Note from the human authors: This article was created to test the ability of ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 language model, in terms of assisting human authors in writing review articles. The text generated by the AI following our instructions (see Supporting Information) was used as a starting point, and its ability to automatically generate content was evaluated. After conducting a thorough review, the human authors practically rewrote the manuscript, striving to maintain a balance between the original proposal and the scientific criteria. The advantages and limitations of using AI for this purpose are discussed in the last section.

AB The potential impacts of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) on society are receiving increased attention owing to the rapid growth of these technologies during the fourth industrial revolution. Thus, a detailed analysis of the positive implications and drawbacks of AI technology in human society is necessary. The development of AI technology has created new markets and employment opportunities in vital industries, including transportation, health, education, and the environment. According to experts, the rapidly increasing improvements in AI will continue. As part of humankind's continual efforts to create more prosperous technological growth, automation and AI are changing people's lives and are widely considered to be game-changers in a variety of industries. This study presents a review of how automation and AI may affect businesses and jobs. To determine some of the prospective long-term consequences of AI on human civilisation, this study investigates a variety of connected primary impacting potentials, including job losses, employees' well-being, dehumanisation of jobs, fear of AI, and examples of autonomous technology developments, such as autonomous-vehicle challenges. A diverse methodology of narrative review and thematic pattern was used to add to transdisciplinary or multidisciplinary work, particularly in the theoretical development of AI technologies.

AB We survey a current, heated debate in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community on whether large pretrained language models can be said to understand language-and the physical and social situations language encodes-in any humanlike sense. We describe argu-ments that have been made for and against such under-standing and key questions for the broader sciences of intelligence that have arisen in light of these arguments. We contend that an extended science of intelligence can be developed that will provide insight into distinct modes of understanding, their strengths and limitations, and the challenge of integrating diverse forms of cognition.

AB ObjectivesTo assess undergraduate medical students' attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology and medicine.Materials and methodsA web-based questionnaire was designed using SurveyMonkey, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students' prior knowledge of AI in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards AI in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents' anonymity was ensured.ResultsA total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52% were aware of the ongoing discussion about AI in radiology and 68% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83%) but felt that AI would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56%). The majority agreed that AI will revolutionise and improve radiology (77% and 86%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for AI to be included in medical training (71%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of AI and less fearful of these technologies.ConclusionContrary to anecdotes published in the media, undergraduate medical students do not worry that AI will replace human radiologists, and are aware of the potential applications and implications of AI on radiology and medicine. Radiology should take the lead in educating students about these emerging technologies.Key Points center dot Medical students are aware of the potential applications and implications of AI in radiology and medicine in general.center dot Medical students do not worry that the human radiologist or physician will be replaced.center dot Artificial intelligence should be included in medical training.

AB Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence and mortality in the world. The overall five-year survival rate of lung cancer is relatively lower than many leading cancers. Early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer are essential to improve the patient's survival rate. With artificial intelligence (AI) approaches widely applied in lung cancer, early diagnosis and prediction have achieved excellent performance in recent years. This review summarizes various types of AI algorithm applications in lung cancer, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and deep learning, and reinforcement learning. In addition, we provides evidence regarding the application of AI in lung cancer diagnostic and clinical prognosis. This review aims to elucidate the value of AI in lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis as the novel screening decision-making for the precise treatment of lung cancer patients.

This article presents the views of a group of international experts on the 'grand challenges' in small-molecule drug discovery with AI, including obtaining appropriate data sets, generating new hypotheses, optimizing in a multi-objective manner, reducing cycle times and changing the research culture.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being applied in drug discovery. While some protagonists point to vast opportunities potentially offered by such tools, others remain sceptical, waiting for a clear impact to be shown in drug discovery projects. The reality is probably somewhere in-between these extremes, yet it is clear that AI is providing new challenges not only for the scientists involved but also for the biopharma industry and its established processes for discovering and developing new medicines. This article presents the views of a diverse group of international experts on the 'grand challenges' in small-molecule drug discovery with AI and the approaches to address them.

AB At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.

AB In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide various artificial autonomy features that allow intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) to assist users in managing the dynamically expanding applications, devices, and services in their daily lives. However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial autonomy and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial autonomy by dividing it into three types of autonomy in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action autonomy. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions-competence and warmth-of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial autonomy and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users' continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design.

AB Tumor immunotherapy, particularly the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, has yielded impressive clinical benefits. Therefore, it is critical to accurately screen individuals for immunotherapy sensitivity and forecast its efficacy. With the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field in recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that the efficacy of immunotherapy can be better anticipated with the help of AI technology to reach precision medicine. This article focuses on the current prediction models based on information from histopathological slides, imaging-omics, genomics, and proteomics, and reviews their research progress and applications. Furthermore, we also discuss the existing challenges encountered by AI in the field of immunotherapy, as well as the future directions that need to be improved, to provide a point of reference for the early implementation of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment systems in the future.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two related technologies that are emergent in financial scholarship. However, no review, to date, has offered a wholistic retrospection of this research. To address this gap, we provide an overview of AI and ML research in finance. Using both co-citation and bibliometric-coupling analyses, we infer the thematic structure of AI and ML research in finance for 1986-April 2021. By uncovering nine (co-citation) and eight (bibliometric coupling) specific clusters of finance that apply AI and ML, we further identify three overarching groups of finance scholarship that are roughly equivalent for both forms of analysis: (1) portfolio construction, valuation, and investor behavior; (2) financial fraud and distress; and (3) sentiment inference, forecasting, and planning. Additionally, using co-occurrence and confluence analyses, we highlight trends and research directions regarding AI and ML in finance research. Our results provide assessment of AI and ML in finance research. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the engine of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation; as such, it has attracted much attention of scholars in recent years. Surprisingly, scarce studies have shed lights on the effects of AI on the environment, especially with respect to carbon intensity. Based on the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, we use Chinese industrial sector data from 2005 to 2016 to investigate how AI affects carbon intensity. The empirical results show that AI, as measured separately by the adoption of robotics by industry and the number of academic AIrelated papers, significantly reduces carbon intensity. The results remain robust after addressing endogenous issues. We find that there are both stages and industrial heterogeneity in the effects of AI on carbon intensity. AI had a more decrease effect on carbon intensity during the 12th Five-Year Plan than the 11th. Compared with capital-intensive industries, AI tends to have a more decrease effect on carbon intensity in the labor-intensive and tech-intensive industries. To enlarge the effects of AI on reducing carbon intensity, the government should promote the development and application of AI and implement differentiated policies in line with the industry characteristics.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been suggested to have transformative potential for public sector organizations through enabling increased productivity and novel ways to deliver public services. In order to materialize the transformative potential of AI, public sector organizations need to successfully assimilate AI in their operational activities. However, AI assimilation in the public sector appears to be fragmented and lagging the private sector, and the phenomena has really limited attention from academic research community. To address this gap, we adopt the case study approach to explore three Saudi-Arabian public sector organizations and analyze the results using the attention-based view of the organization (ABV) as the theoretical lens. This study elucidates the challenges related AI assimilation in public sector in terms of how organizational attention is focused situated and distributed during the assimilation process. Five key challenges emerged from the cases studied, namely (i) misalignment between AI and management decision-making, (ii) tensions with linguistics and national culture, (iii) developing and implementing AI infrastructure, (iv) data integrity and sharing, and (v) ethical and governance concerns. The findings reveal a re-enforcing relationship between the situated attention and structural distribution of attention that can accelerate the successful assimilation of AI in public sector organizations.

AB The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Digital technologies (DT) is proliferating a profound socio-technical transformation. Governments and AI scholarship have endorsed key AI principles but lack direction at the implementation level. Through a systematic literature review of 59 papers, this paper contributes to the critical debate on the ethical use of AI in DTs beyond high-level AI principles. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that identifies 14 digital ethics implications for the use of AI in seven DT archetypes using a novel ontological framework (physical, cognitive, information, and governance). The paper presents key findings of the review and a conceptual model with twelve propositions highlighting the impact of digital ethics implications on societal impact, as moderated by DT archetypes and mediated by organisational impact. The implications of intelligibility, accountability, fairness, and autonomy (under the cognitive domain), and privacy (under the information domain) are the most widely discussed in our sample. Furthermore, ethical implications related to the governance domain are shown to be generally applicable for most DT archetypes. Implications under the physical domain are less prominent when it comes to AI diffusion with one exception (safety). The key findings and resulting conceptual model have academic and professional implications.

AB The thriving of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is driving the further evolution of wireless networks. It has been envisioned that 6G will be transformative and will revolutionize the evolution of wireless from "connected things" to "connected intelligence". However, state-of-the-art deep learning and big data analytics based AI systems require tremendous computation and communication resources, causing significant latency, energy consumption, network congestion, and privacy leakage in both of the training and inference processes. By embedding model training and inference capabilities into the network edge, edge AI stands out as a disruptive technology for 6G to seamlessly integrate sensing, communication, computation, and intelligence, thereby improving the efficiency, effectiveness, privacy, and security of 6G networks. In this paper, we shall provide our vision for scalable and trustworthy edge AI systems with integrated design of wireless communication strategies and decentralized machine learning models. New design principles of wireless networks, service-driven resource allocation optimization methods, as well as a holistic end-to-end system architecture to support edge AI will be described. Standardization, software and hardware platforms, and application scenarios are also discussed to facilitate the industrialization and commercialization of edge AI systems.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become a very popular buzzword, as a consequence of disruptive technical advances and impressive experimental results, notably in the field of image analysis and processing. In medicine, specialties where images are central, like radiology, pathology or oncology, have seized the opportunity and considerable efforts in research and development have been deployed to transfer the potential of AI to clinical applications. With AI becoming a more mainstream tool for typical medical imaging analysis tasks, such as diagnosis, segmentation, or classification, the key for a safe and efficient use of clinical AI applications relies, in part, on informed practitioners. The aim of this review is to present the basic technological pillars of AI, together with the state-of-the-art machine learning methods and their application to medical imaging. In addition, we discuss the new trends and future research directions. This will help the reader to understand how AI methods are now becoming an ubiquitous tool in any medical image analysis workflow and pave the way for the clinical implementation of AI-based solutions.

AB Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel "word-of-machine" effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1-4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person's unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human-AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a-b).

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-defined as a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation is a topic in nearly every boardroom and at many dinner tables. Yet, despite this prominence, Al-is still a surprisingly fuzzy concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this article, we analyze how Al is different from related concepts, such as the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that Al is not one monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This can either be achieved by looking at Al through the lens of evolutionary stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of Al systems (analytical Al, human-inspired AI, and humanized Al). Based on this classification, we show the potential and risk of Al using a series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control.

AB This exploratory study explores perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and organizational readiness to adopt AI, in the exhibition sector of the events industry. A theoretical framework synthesizing the Technology - Organization - Environment framework and the Technology Readiness Index was developed to guide this qualitative study. Seventeen senior managerial representatives from exhibition organizations across nine Western European countries were interviewed, and a reflexive thematic approach was adopted to analyse the data. The findings suggest that the European exhibition industry is a slow adopter of AI, which may impact its future competitiveness, despite the stimulus provided to AI adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree of confidence in organizational technological practices, financial resources, the size of the organization, and issues of data management and protection, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, motivate or inhibit readiness for AI adoption in the event industry. A new Exhibition Sector Readiness for AI Adoption Model is presented in this research that managers and researchers can use to analyze inhibitors and motivations for AI adoption, which is contextualized for the current challenges facing the exhibitions sector.

AB AI has the potential to reshape medicine and make healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible; this Review discusses recent progress, opportunities and challenges toward achieving this goal.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to broadly reshape medicine, potentially improving the experiences of both clinicians and patients. We discuss key findings from a 2-year weekly effort to track and share key developments in medical AI. We cover prospective studies and advances in medical image analysis, which have reduced the gap between research and deployment. We also address several promising avenues for novel medical AI research, including non-image data sources, unconventional problem formulations and human-AI collaboration. Finally, we consider serious technical and ethical challenges in issues spanning from data scarcity to racial bias. As these challenges are addressed, AI's potential may be realized, making healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible for patients worldwide.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way retail stores operate. AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores are the next revolution in physical retail. Consumers are facing fully automated technology in these retail stores. Therefore, it is necessary to scrutinize the antecedents of consumers' intention to shop at AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores. This study delves into this area to find the predictors of consumers' intention to shop at AI-Powered Automated Retail Stores. It extends the technology readiness and acceptance model by the addition of AI context specific constructs such as Perceived Enjoyment, Customization and Interactivity from the present literature. The proposed model is tested by surveying 1250 consumers & the data is analyzed using the PLS-SEM technique and empirically validated. The outcome of the study reveals that Innovativeness and Optimism of consumers affect the perceived ease and perceived usefulness. Insecurity negatively affects the perceived usefulness of AI-powered automated retail stores. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, customization and interactivity are significant predictors of shopping intention of consumers in AI-powered automated stores. This research presents insightful academic and managerial implications in the domain of retailing and technology in retail.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)'s rapid development has produced a variety of state-of-the-art models and methods that rely on network architectures and features engineering. However, some AI approaches achieve high accurate results only at the expense of interpretability and reliability. These problems may easily lead to bad experiences, lower trust levels, and systematic or even catastrophic risks. This article introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering for building trustworthy AI techniques. We propose six key dimensions, including intelligence and index, calibration and certification, and verification and validation to achieve more robust and trusting AI, and address issues for future research directions and applications along this direction.

AB A decade ago, we published an article in Business Horizons about the challenges and opportunities of social media with a call to action: "Users of the world, unite!" To celebrate its anniversary, we look at artificial intelligence and the need to create the rules necessary for peaceful coexistence between humanity and AI. Hence, we now are urging: "Rulers of the world, unite!" In this article, we outline six debates surrounding AI in areas like artificial superintelligence, geographical progress, and robotics; in doing so, we shed light on what is fact and what is utopia. Then, using the PESTEL framework, we talk about the six dilemmas of AI and its potential threat and use. Finally, we provide six directions on the future of AI regarding its requirements and expectations, looking at enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente, and evolution. Understanding AI's potential future will enable governments, corporations, and societies at large (i.e., the rulers of this world) to prepare for its challenges and opportunities. This way, we can avoid a scenario in which we return in 10 years to write the article: "Dreamers of the world, unite!" (C) 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

AB Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BT), have revolutionized the way businesses are managed nowadays, whereas the focus on financial resilience remains critical even in an era of complexity and uncertainty. This study empirically explores the capabilities of AI and BT to ascertain its role in financial resilience of a supply chain. Further study considers the environmental dynamism moderating the relationship of AI and BT leading to financial resilience of supply chains. Adopting a multi-methodological approach, we conduct an empirical and qualitative study to explore the relationship between AI, BT, and the financial resilience of supply chains. For data collection, 202 survey responses from supply chain professionals were collected to test the theoretical model, whereas the qualitative study collected responses from 25 supply chain professionals using semi-structured interviews and the grounded approach. After using structural equation modeling for the quantitative data analysis, our findings indicate that, compared to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology is stronger in facilitating financial resilience of a supply chain under the moderating influence of environmental dynamism. Thematic analysis for the qualitative study indicate the role of AI in sensing, blockchain in seizing and financial resilience in reconfiguring the opportunities lie in supply chain. AI is suitable for sensing the business environment and facilitating blockchain deployment. This study offers a theoretical contribution, along with practical implications for managers.

AB Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Demand Response (DR) as a means to provide flexibility, and hence improve the reliability of energy systems in a cost-effective way. Yet, the high complexity of the tasks associated with DR, combined with their use of large-scale data and the frequent need for near real-time decisions, means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) - a branch of AI - have recently emerged as key technologies for enabling demand-side response. AI methods can be used to tackle various challenges, ranging from selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, scheduling and control of devices, learning how to incentivise participants in the DR schemes and how to reward them in a fair and economically efficient way. This work provides an overview of AI methods utilised for DR applications, based on a systematic review of over 160 papers, 40 companies and commercial initiatives, and 21 large-scale projects. The papers are classified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy DR. Next, commercial initiatives are presented (including both start-ups and established companies) and large-scale innovation projects, where AI methods have been used for energy DR. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different DR tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be an efficient alternative approach to classical modeling techniques. AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.

AB With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.

AB Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities - inherited from over 500 million years of evolution - that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.

AB More information about a person's genetic makeup, drug response, multi-omics response, and genomic response is now available leading to a gradual shift towards personalized treatment. Additionally, the promotion of non -animal testing has fueled the computational toxicogenomics as a pivotal part of the next-gen risk assessment paradigm. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to provid new ways analyzing the patient data and making predictions about treatment outcomes or toxicity. As personalized medicine and toxicogenomics involve huge data processing, AI can expedite this process by providing powerful data processing, analysis, and interpretation algorithms. AI can process and integrate a multitude of data including genome data, patient records, clinical data and identify patterns to derive predictive models anticipating clinical outcomes and assessing the risk of any personalized medicine approaches. In this article, we have studied the current trends and future perspectives in personalized medicine & toxicology, the role of toxicogenomics in connecting the two fields, and the impact of AI on personalized medicine & toxicology. In this work, we also study the key challenges and limitations in personalized medicine, toxicogenomics, and AI in order to fully realize their potential.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted by organizations to innovate, and this is ever more reflected in scholarly work. To illustrate, assess and map research at the intersection of AI and innovation, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science (WOS) and Elsevier Scopus databases (the final sample includes 1448 articles). A bibliometric analysis was deployed to map the focal field in terms of dominant topics and their evolution over time. By deploying keyword co-occurrences, and bibliographic coupling techniques, we generate insights on the literature at the intersection of AI and innovation research. We leverage the SLR findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work on the focal research area and to develop an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. We identify economic, technological, and social factors of AI adoption in firms willing to innovate. We also uncover firms' economic, competitive and organizational, and innovation factors as key outcomes of AI deployment. We conclude this paper by developing an agenda for future research.

AB Monthly streamflow forecasting is required for short- and long-term water resources management especially in extreme events such as flood and drought. Therefore, there is need to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting. The precision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can be improved by using hybrid AI models which consist of coupled models. Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique. Quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models; in addition to that, comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow. The results show the integrated AI with GWO outperform the standard AI methods and can make better forecasting during training and testing phases for the monthly inflow in all input cases. This finding reveals the superiority of GWO meta-heuristic algorithm in improving the accuracy of the standard AI in forecasting the monthly inflow.

AB Widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is substantially affecting the human condition in ways that are not yet well understood. Negative unintended consequences abound including the perpetuation and exacerbation of societal inequalities and divisions via algorithmic decision making. We present six grand challenges for the scientific community to create AI technologies that are human-centered, that is, ethical, fair, and enhance the human condition. These grand challenges are the result of an international collaboration across academia, industry and government and represent the consensus views of a group of 26 experts in the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). In essence, these challenges advocate for a human-centered approach to AI that (1) is centered in human well-being, (2) is designed responsibly, (3) respects privacy, (4) follows human-centered design principles, (5) is subject to appropriate governance and oversight, and (6) interacts with individuals while respecting human's cognitive capacities. We hope that these challenges and their associated research directions serve as a call for action to conduct research and development in AI that serves as a force multiplier towards more fair, equitable and sustainable societies.

AB The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is growing rapidly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare applications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute illness at remote locations, elderly people in-home care, and even hospitalized patients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff time management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient monitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor health status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems including adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and trends in AI-enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of patient-centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable devices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies. The role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic disease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This review results show that AI-enabled RPM architectures have transformed healthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early deterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health parameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior patterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning. This review discusses the challenges and trends to adopt AI to RPM systems and implementation issues. The future directions of AI in RPM applications are analyzed based on the challenges and trends.This article is categorized under:Application Areas > Health CareTechnologies > Artificial IntelligenceTechnologies > Internet of Things

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research.

AB As the driving force behind the new wave of technological advancement, artificial intelligence (AI) paves the way for a new era of green economic growth. This paper uses the case of China and constructs a relevant mathematical model to propose the two-way impact of AI on green total factor productivity (GTFP) and systematically analyze the impact of AI on green economic growth. The main findings of this study are that AI has a significant "U-shaped" effect on GTFP, which was estimated using a nonlinear dynamic panel regression model. The analysis of regional heterogeneity shows that improving AI in resource-rich areas can boost GTFP and break the "resource curse". The "productivity paradox" arises, according to the industry heterogeneity analysis, because the current lowlevel of intelligence in resourceintensive and labor-intensive industries fails to improve GTFP. This paper also breaks down GTFP into green technological progress and green efficiency improvement effects to figure out how AI affects green economic growth.

AB Since 2010, substantial progress has been made in artificial intelligence (AI) and its application to medicine. AI is explored in gastroenterology for endoscopic analysis of lesions, in detection of cancer, and to facilitate the analysis of inflammatory lesions or gastrointestinal bleeding during wireless capsule endoscopy. AI is also tested to assess liver fibrosis and to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from those with pancreatitis. AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments, based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations, knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities.

AB Computer science advances and ultra-fast computing speeds find artificial intelligence (AI) broadly benefitting modern society-forecasting weather, recognizing faces, detecting fraud, and deciphering genomics. AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.

AB In the recent year, Internet of Things (IoT) is industrializing in several real-world applications such as smart transportation, smart city to make human life reliable. With the increasing industrialization in IoT, an excessive amount of sensing data is producing from various sensors devices in the Industrial IoT. To analyzes of big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role as a strong analytic tool and delivers a scalable and accurate analysis of data in real-time. However, the design and development of a useful big data analysis tool using AI have some challenges, such as centralized architecture, security, and privacy, resource constraints, lack of enough training data. Conversely, as an emerging technology, Blockchain supports a decentralized architecture. It provides a secure sharing of data and resources to the various nodes of the IoT network is encouraged to remove centralized control and can overcome the existing challenges in AI. The main goal of our research is to design and develop an IoT architecture with blockchain and AI to support an effective big data analysis. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Intelligent IoT Architecture with Artificial Intelligence that provides an efficient way of converging blockchain and AI for IoT with current state-of-theart techniques and applications. We evaluate the proposed architecture and categorized into two parts: qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative evaluation, we describe how to use AI and Blockchain in IoT applications with "AI-driven Blockchain" and "Blockchain-driven AI." In quantitative analysis, we present a performance evaluation of the BlockloTlntelligence architecture to compare existing researches on device, fog, edge and cloud intelligence according to some parameters such as accuracy, latency, security and privacy, computational complexity and energy cost in IoT applications. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture performance over the existing IoT architectures and mitigate the current challenges. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a crucial role in providing diversified services because of its powerful capability of collecting real-time information. Generally, collected information is transmitted to a centralized resource-intensive cloud platform for service implementation. Edge Computing (EC) that deploys physical resources near road-side units is involved in IoV to support real-time services for vehicular users. Additionally, many measures are adopted to optimize the performance of EC-enabled IoV, but they hardly help make dynamic decisions according to real-time requests. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of enhancing the learning capacity of edge devices and thus assists in allocating resources dynamically. Although extensive research has employed AI to optimize EC performance, summaries with relative concepts or prospects are quite few. To address this gap, we conduct an exhaustive survey about utilizing AI in edge service optimization in IoV. Firstly, we establish the general condition and relative concepts about IoV, EC, and AI. Secondly, we review the edge service frameworks for IoV and explore the use of AI in edge server placement and service offloading. Finally, we discuss a number of open issues in optimizing edge services with AI.

AB Learning mathematics has been considered as a great challenge for many students. The advancement of computer technologies, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), provides an opportunity to cope with this problem by diagnosing individual students' learning problems and providing personalized supports to maximize their learning performances in mathematics courses. However, there is a lack of reviews from diverse perspectives to help researchers, especially novices, gain a whole picture of the research of AI in mathematics education. To this end, this research aims to conduct a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to explore the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching for the relevant articles published in the quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WOS) database. Moreover, by referring to the technology-based learning model, several dimensions of AI in mathematics education research, such as the application domains, participants, research methods, adopted technologies, research issues and the roles of AI as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account. Accordingly, the advancements of AI in mathematics education research are reported, and potential research topics for future research are recommended.

AB Automation with inherent artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The waste management processes typically involve numerous technical, climatic, environmental, demographic, socio-economic, and legislative parameters. Such complex nonlinear processes are challenging to model, predict and optimize using conventional methods. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gained momentum in offering alternative computational approaches to solve solid waste management (SWM) problems. AI has been efficient at tackling ill-defined problems, learning from experience, and handling uncertainty and incomplete data. Although significant research was carried out in this domain, very few review studies have assessed the potential of AI in solving the diverse SWM problems. This systematic literature review compiled 85 research studies, published between 2004 and 2019, analyzing the application of AI in various SWM fields, including forecasting of waste characteristics, waste bin level detection, process parameters prediction, vehicle routing, and SWM planning. This review provides comprehensive analysis of the different AI models and techniques applied in SWM, application domains and reported performance parameters, as well as the software platforms used to implement such models. The challenges and insights of applying AI techniques in SWM are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) characterizes a new generation of technologies capable of interacting with the environment and aiming to simulate human intelligence. The success of integrating AI into organizations critically depends on workers' trust in AI technology. This review explains how AI differs from other technologies and presents the existing empirical research on the determinants of human "trust" in AI, conducted in multiple disciplines over the last 20 years. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify the form of AI representation (robot, virtual, and embedded) and its level of machine intelligence (i.e., its capabilities) as important antecedents to the development of trust and propose a framework that addresses the elements that shape users' cognitive and emotional trust. Our review reveals the important role of AI's tangibility, transparency, reliability, and immediacy behaviors in developing cognitive trust, and the role of AI's anthropomorphism specifically for emotional trust. We also note several limitations in the current evidence base, such as the diversity of trust measures and overreliance on short-term, small sample, and experimental studies, where the development of trust is likely to be different than in longer-term, higher stakes field environments.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. However, alongside all its advancements, problems have also emerged, such as privacy violations, security issues and model fairness. Differential privacy, as a promising mathematical model, has several attractive properties that can help solve these problems, making it quite a valuable tool. For this reason, differential privacy has been broadly applied in AI but to date, no study has documented which differential privacy mechanisms can or have been leveraged to overcome its issues or the properties that make this possible. In this paper, we show that differential privacy can do more than just privacy preservation. It can also be used to improve security, stabilize learning, build fair models, and impose composition in selected areas of AI. With a focus on regular machine learning, distributed machine learning, deep learning, and multi-agent systems, the purpose of this article is to deliver a new view on many possibilities for improving AI performance with differential privacy techniques.

AB Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction

   DISCRETION; ALGORITHM; RISK
AB Artificial Intelligence is increasingly used to support and improve street-level decision-making, but empirical evidence on how street-level bureaucrats' work is affected by AI technologies is scarce. We investigate how AI recommendations affect street-level bureaucrats' decision-making and if explainable AI increases trust in such recommendations. We experimentally tested a realistic mock predictive policing system in a sample of Dutch police officers using a 2 x 2 factorial design. We found that police officers trust and follow AI recommendations that are congruent with their intuitive professional judgment. We found no effect of explanations on trust in AI recommendations. We conclude that police officers do not blindly trust AI technologies, but follow AI recommendations that confirm what they already thought. This highlights the potential of street-level discretion in correcting faulty AI recommendations on the one hand, but, on the other hand, poses serious limits to the hope that fair AI systems can correct human biases.

AB In October 2016, the White House, the European Parliament, and the UK House of Commons each issued a report outlining their visions on how to prepare society for the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, we provide a comparative assessment of these three reports in order to facilitate the design of policies favourable to the development of a 'good AI society'. To do so, we examine how each report addresses the following three topics: (a) the development of a 'good AI society'; (b) the role and responsibility of the government, the private sector, and the research community (including academia) in pursuing such a development; and (c) where the recommendations to support such a development may be in need of improvement. Our analysis concludes that the reports address adequately various ethical, social, and economic topics, but come short of providing an overarching political vision and long-term strategy for the development of a 'good AI society'. In order to contribute to fill this gap, in the conclusion we suggest a two-pronged approach.

AB The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is beginning to alter current procedures in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration, cure of disease and other physical and mental impairments. In addition to raising concerns about public trust and ethics, advancements in this new emerging technology have also led to a lot of debate around its integration into healthcare. The objective of this work is to introduce researchers to AI and its medical applications, along with their potential pitfalls, in a comprehensive manner. This paper provides a review of current studies that have investigated how to apply AI methodologies to create a smart predictive maintenance model for the industries of the future. We begin with a brief introduction to AI and a decade's worth of its advancements across a variety of industries, including smart grids, train transportation, etc., and most recently, healthcare. In this paper, we explore the various applications of AI across various medical specialties, including radiology, dermatology, haematology, ophthalmology, etc. along with the comparative study by employing several key criteria. Finally, it highlights the challenges for large-scale integration of AI in medical systems along with a summary of the ethical, legal, trust, and future implications of AI in healthcare.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly opening up a new frontier in the fields of business, corporate practices, and governmental policy. The intelligence of machines and robotics with deep learning capabilities have created profound disrupting and enabling impacts on business, governments, and society. They are also influencing the larger trends in global sustainability. As the AI revolution transforms our world, it could herald a utopian future where humanity co-exists harmoniously with machines, or portend a dystopian world filled with conflict, poverty and suffering. More immediately, would AI accelerate our progress on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or bring us further down the path toward greater economic uncertainty, environmental collapse, and social upheaval? What are some of the implications for business leadership and the education of future business leaders? This article aims to address these questions by analyzing the impacts of AI in three case studies. It draws some preliminary inferences for management education and the business of leading corporations in the midst of rapid technological and social change. This study combines the perspectives of business strategy and public policy to analyze the impacts of AI on sustainable development with a specific focus on the advancement of the SDGs. It also draws some lessons on managerial learning and leadership development for global sustainability.

AB ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as "the printing press", with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the "AI arms race", creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.

ID DEEP; CLASSIFICATION; FUTURE
AB Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability of large datasets ("big data"), substantial advances in computing power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature, better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program use across different imaging platforms and Patient populations. AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract "radiomic" information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists. AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data. Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a leading role in medical applications of AI.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, detection accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. This review also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing efficient POC biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent healthcare.

AB Drug repurposing or repositioning is a technique whereby existing drugs are used to treat emerging and challenging diseases, including COVID-19. Drug repurposing has become a promising approach because of the opportunity for reduced development timelines and overall costs. In the big data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine offer cutting-edge application of information science to defining disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifying targets with the least error. In this Review, we introduce guidelines on how to use AI for accelerating drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches are not just formidable but are also necessary. We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, and as an example, how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies can expedite therapeutic development. This Review provides a strong rationale for using AI-based assistive tools for drug repurposing medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB The use of transformer-based language models in artificial intelligence (AI) has increased adoption in various industries and led to significant productivity advancements in business operations. This article explores how these models can be used to augment human innovation teams in the new product development process, allowing for larger problem and solution spaces to be explored and ultimately leading to higher innovation performance. The article proposes the use of the AI-augmented double diamond framework to structure the exploration of how these models can assist in new product development (NPD) tasks, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and idea generation. It also discusses the limitations of the technology and the potential impact of AI on established practices in NPD. The article establishes a research agenda for exploring the use of language models in this area and the role of humans in hybrid innovation teams. (Note: Following the idea of this article, GPT-3 alone generated this abstract. Only minor formatting edits were performed by humans.)

AB AI has received increased attention from the information systems (IS) research community in recent years. There is, however, a growing concern that research on AI could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge, which has overshadowed IS research previously. This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented. In doing so, this study makes important contributions, namely (i) an identification of the current reported business value and contributions of AI, (ii) research and practical implications on the use of AI and (iii) opportunities for future AI research in the form of a research agenda.

AB Data science is likely to lead to major changes in cardiovascular imaging. Problems with timing, efficiency, and missed diagnoses occur at all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is dependent on robust data; the application of appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its clinical application to image segmentation, automated measurements, and eventually, automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at the stages of image acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making. Moreover, the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging, combined with "big data" from the electronic health record and pathology, is likely to better characterize disease and personalize therapy. This review summarizes recent promising applications of AI in cardiology and cardiac imaging, which potentially add value to patient care. (c) 2019 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB Over the past decade, the amount of biomedical data available has grown at unprecedented rates. Increased automation tech-nology and larger data volumes have encouraged the use of machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for mining such data and extracting useful patterns. Because the identification of chemical entities with desired biological activ-ity is a crucial task in drug discovery, AI technologies have the potential to accelerate this process and support decision making. In addition, the advent of deep learning (DL) has shown great promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery, such as de novo molecular design. Herein, we will appraise the current state-of-the-art in AI-assisted drug discovery, discussing the recent applications covering generative models for chemical structure generation, scoring functions to improve binding affinity and pose prediction, and molecular dynamics to assist in the parametrization, featurization and generalization tasks. Finally, we will discuss current hurdles and the strategies to overcome them, as well as potential future directions.

AB The emergence of massively parallel yet affordable computing devices has been a game changer for research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, dramatic investment from the web giants has fostered the development of a high-quality software stack. Going forward, the combination of faster computers with dedicated software libraries and the widespread availability of data has opened the door to more flexibility in the design of AI models. Radiomics is a process used to discover new imaging biomarkers that has multiple applications in radiology and can be used in conjunction with AI. AI can be used throughout the various pro-cesses of diagnostic imaging, including data acquisition, reconstruction, analysis and reporting. Today, the concept of "AI-augmented" radiologists is preferred to the theory of the replacement of radiologists by AI in many indications. Current evidence bolsters the assumption that AI-assisted radiologists work better and faster. Interventional radiology becomes a data-rich specialty where the entire procedure is fully recorded in a standardized DICOM format and accessible via standard picture archiving and communication systems. No other interventional specialty can bolster such readiness. In this setting, interventional radiology could lead the development of AI-powered applications in the broader interventional community. This article provides an update on the current status of radiomics and AI research, analyzes upcoming challenges and also dis-cusses the main applications in AI in interventional radiology to help radiologists better understand and criti-cize articles reporting AI in medical imaging.(c) 2022 Societe francaise de radiologie.

AB The legal and ethical issues that confront society due to Artificial Intelligence (AI) include privacy and surveillance, bias or discrimination, and potentially the philosophical challenge is the role of human judgment. Concerns about newer digital technologies becoming a new source of inaccuracy and data breaches have arisen as a result of its use. Mistakes in the procedure or protocol in the field of healthcare can have devastating consequences for the patient who is the victim of the error. Because patients come into contact with physicians at moments in their lives when they are most vulnerable, it is crucial to remember this. Currently, there are no well-defined regulations in place to address the legal and ethical issues that may arise due to the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings. This review attempts to address these pertinent issues highlighting the need for algorithmic transparency, privacy, and protection of all the beneficiaries involved and cybersecurity of associated vulnerabilities.

AB Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are playing an increasing role in biomedical research and healthcare services. This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context.
   Methods: A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections.
   Results: We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way.
   Conclusions: Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice.

AB ChatGPT has promising applications in health care, but potential ethical issues need to be addressed proactively to prevent harm. ChatGPT presents potential ethical challenges from legal, humanistic, algorithmic, and informational perspectives. Legal ethics concerns arise from the unclear allocation of responsibility when patient harm occurs and from potential breaches of patient privacy due to data collection. Clear rules and legal boundaries are needed to properly allocate liability and protect users. Humanistic ethics concerns arise from the potential disruption of the physician-patient relationship, humanistic care, and issues of integrity. Overreliance on artificial intelligence (AI) can undermine compassion and erode trust. Transparency and disclosure of AI-generated content are critical to maintaining integrity. Algorithmic ethics raise concerns about algorithmic bias, responsibility, transparency and explainability, as well as validation and evaluation. Information ethics include data bias, validity, and effectiveness. Biased training data can lead to biased output, and overreliance on ChatGPT can reduce patient adherence and encourage self-diagnosis. Ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and validity of ChatGPT-generated content requires rigorous validation and ongoing updates based on clinical practice. To navigate the evolving ethical landscape of AI, AI in health care must adhere to the strictest ethical standards. Through comprehensive ethical guidelines, health care professionals can ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT, promote accurate and reliable information exchange, protect patient privacy, and empower patients to make informed decisions about their health care.

AB BackgroundWith the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. ObjectiveThis study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots. MethodsThe articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. ResultsA total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: "Diagnosis and Prediction AI-related study", "Non-surgery AI-related study", and "Surgery AI-related study". Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were "deep learning" and "multiparametric MRI". ConclusionsArtificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future. It can be projected that noninvasive diagnosis and accurate minimally invasive treatment through deep learning technology will still be the research focus in the next few years.

AB The fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long and intertwined history. In more recent times, however, communication and collaboration between the two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we argue that better understanding biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields.

AB The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.

AB The pandemic has catalyzed a significant shift to online/blended teaching and learning where teachers apply emerging technologies to enhance their students' learning outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has gained its popularity in online learning environments during the pandemic to assist students' learning. However, many of these AI tools are new to teachers. They may not have rich technical knowledge to use AI educational applications to facilitate their teaching, not to mention developing students' AI digital capabilities. As such, there is a growing need for teachers to equip themselves with adequate digital competencies so as to use and teach AI in their teaching environments. There are few existing frameworks informing teachers of necessary AI competencies. This study first explores the opportunities and challenges of employing AI systems and how they can enhance teaching, learning and assessment. Then, aligning with generic digital competency frameworks, the DigCompEdu framework and P21's framework for twenty-first century learning were adapted and revised to accommodate AI technologies. Recommendations are proposed to support educators and researchers to promote AI education in their classrooms and academia.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring both opportunities and challenges to human resource management (HRM). While scholars have been examining the impact of AI on workplace outcomes more closely over the past two decades, the literature falls short in providing a holistic scholarly review of this body of research. Such a review is needed in order to: (a) guide future research on the effects of AI on the workplace; and (b) help managers make proper use of AI technology to improve workplace and organizational outcomes.This is the first systematic review to explore the relationship between artificial intelligence and workplace outcomes. Through an exhaustive systematic review and analysis of existing literature, we ultimately examine and cross-relate 60 papers, published in 30 leading international (AJG 3 and 4) journals over a period of 25 years (1995-2020). Our review researches the AI-workplace outcomes nexus by drawing on the major functions of human resource management and the process framework of 'antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes' at multiple levels of analysis. We review the sampled articles based on years of publication, theories, methods, and key themes across the 'antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes' framework. We provide useful directions for future research by embedding our discussion within HR literature, while we recommend topics drawing on alternative units of analysis and theories that draw on the individual, team, and institutional levels.

By utilizing AI algorithms that analyze extensive biological data, including genomics and proteomics, researchers can identify disease-associated targets and predict their interactions with potential drug candidates. This enables a more efficient and targeted approach to drug discovery, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful drug approvals. Furthermore, AI can contribute to reducing development costs by optimizing research and development processes. Machine learning algorithms assist in experimental design and can predict the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of drug candidates. This capability enables the prioritization and optimization of lead compounds, reducing the need for extensive and costly animal testing. Personalized medicine approaches can be facilitated through AI algorithms that analyze real-world patient data, leading to more effective treatment outcomes and improved patient adherence. This comprehensive review explores the wide-ranging applications of AI in drug discovery, drug delivery dosage form designs, process optimization, testing, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies. This review provides an overview of various AI-based approaches utilized in pharmaceutical technology, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks. Nevertheless, the continued investment in and exploration of AI in the pharmaceutical industry offer exciting prospects for enhancing drug development processes and patient care.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform health care practices with its increasing ability to translate the uncertainty and complexity in data into actionable-though imperfect-clinical decisions or suggestions. In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians' use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI. We highlight critical challenges related to trust that should be considered during the development of any AI system for clinical use.

AB In today's global culture where the Internet has established itself as the main tool for communication and commerce, the capability to massively analyze and predict citizens' behavior has become a priority for governments in terms of collective intelligence and security. At the same time, in the context of novel possibilities that artificial intelligence (AI) brings to governments in terms of understanding and developing collective behavior analysis, important concerns related to citizens' privacy have emerged. In order to identify the main uses that governments make of AI and to define citizens' concerns about their privacy, in the present study, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, conducted in-depth interviews, and applied data-mining techniques. Based on our results, we classified and discussed the risks to citizens' privacy according to the types of AI strategies used by governments that may affect collective behavior and cause massive behavior modification. Our results revealed 11 uses of AI strategies used by the government to improve their interaction with citizens, organizations in cities, services provided by public institutions or the economy, among other areas. In relation to citizens' privacy when AI is used by governments, we identified 8 topics related to human behavior predictions, intelligence decision making, decision automation, digital surveillance, data privacy law and regulation, and the risk of behavior modification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the development of regulations focused on the ethical design of citizen data collection, where implications for governments are presented aimed at regulating security, ethics, and data privacy. Additionally, we propose a research agenda composed by 16 research questions to be investigated in further research.

AB With the breakthroughs in deep learning, the recent years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in language education; however, the trends, research issues, and applications of AI in language learning remain largely under-investigated. Accordingly, the present paper, using bibliometric analysis, investigates these issues via a review of 516 papers published between 2000 and 2019, focusing on how AI was integrated into language education. Findings revealed that the frequency of studies on AI-enhanced language education increased over the period. The USA and Arizona State University were the most active country and institution, respectively. The 10 most popular topics were: (1) automated writing evaluation; (2) intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for reading and writing; (3) automated error detection; (4) computer-mediated communication; (5) personalized systems for language learning; (6) natural language and vocabulary learning; (7) web resources and web-based systems for language learning; (8) ITS for writing in English for specific purposes; (9) intelligent tutoring and assessment systems for pronunciation and speech training; and (10) affective states and emotions. The results also indicated that AI was frequently used to assist students in learning writing, reading, vocabulary, grammar, speaking, and listening. Natural language processing, automated speech recognition, and learner profiling were commonly applied to develop automated writing evaluation, personalized learning, and intelligent tutoring systems.

AB This paper examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address societal megatrends, with a specific focus on OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). To do this, we conducted an analysis using GPT-3 in order to explore the benefits of AI for digitalization, urbanization, globalization, climate change, automation and mobility, global health issues, and the aging population. We also looked at emerging markets as well as sustainability in this study. Interaction with GPT-3 was conducted solely through prompt questions, and generated responses were analyzed. Our results indicate that AI can significantly improve our understanding of these megatrends by providing insights into how they develop over time and which solutions could be implemented. Further research is needed to determine how effective AI will be in addressing them successfully, but initial findings are encouraging. Our discussion focuses on the implications of our findings for society going forward and suggests that further investigation should be conducted into how best to utilize new technologies such as GPT-3 when tackling these challenges. Lastly, we conclude that, while there is still much work left to do before any tangible effects can be seen from utilizing AI tools such as GPT-3 on societal megatrends, early indications suggest it may have a positive impact if used correctly.

AB Objectives: ChatGPT, a tool based on natural language processing (NLP), is on everyone's mind, and several potential applications in healthcare have been already proposed. However, since the ability of this tool to interpret laboratory test results has not yet been tested, the EFLM Working group on Artificial Intelligence (WG-AI) has set itself the task of closing this gap with a systematic approach.Methods: WG-AI members generated 10 simulated laboratory reports of common parameters, which were then passed to ChatGPT for interpretation, according to reference intervals (RI) and units, using an optimized prompt. The results were subsequently evaluated independently by all WG-AI members with respect to relevance, correctness, helpfulness and safety.Results: ChatGPT recognized all laboratory tests, it could detect if they deviated from the RI and gave a test-by-test as well as an overall interpretation. The interpretations were rather superficial, not always correct, and, only in some cases, judged coherently. The magnitude of the deviation from the RI seldom plays a role in the interpretation of laboratory tests, and artificial intelligence (AI) did not make any meaningful suggestion regarding follow-up diagnostics or further procedures in general.Conclusions: ChatGPT in its current form, being not specifically trained on medical data or laboratory data in particular, may only be considered a tool capable of interpreting a laboratory report on a test-by-test basis at best, but not on the interpretation of an overall diagnostic picture. Future generations of similar AIs with medical ground truth training data might surely revolutionize current processes in healthcare, despite this implementation is not ready yet.

AB Remote sensing (RS) plays an important role gathering data in many critical domains (e.g., global climate change, risk assessment and vulnerability reduction of natural hazards, resilience of ecosystems, and urban planning). Retrieving, managing, and analyzing large amounts of RS imagery poses substantial challenges. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a scalable, cloud-based, geospatial retrieval and processing platform. GEE also provides access to the vast majority of freely available, public, multi-temporal RS data and offers free cloud-based computational power for geospatial data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are a critical enabling technology to automating the interpretation of RS imagery, particularly on object-based domains, so the integration of AI methods into GEE represents a promising path towards operationalizing automated RS-based monitoring programs. In this article, we provide a systematic review of relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI methods in GEE. We then discuss some of the major challenges of integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future research. We developed an interactive web application designed to allow readers to intuitively and dynamically review the publications included in this literature review.

AB The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics in the healthcare setting to advance disease diagnosis and management and facilitate the creation of new therapeutics is gaining popularity. Given the vast amount of data collected during cancer therapy, there is significant concern in leveraging the algorithms and technologies available with the underlying goal of improving oncologic care. Radiologists will attain better precision and effectiveness with the advent of AI technology, making machine-assisted medical services a valuable and important option for future oncologic medical care. As a result, it is critical to figure out which specific radiology activities are best positioned to gain from AI and radiomics models and methods of oncologic imaging, while also considering the algorithms' capabilities and constraints. Our purpose is to overview the current evidence and future prospects of AI and radiomics algorithms used in oncologic imaging efforts with an emphasis on the three most frequent cancers worldwide, i.e., lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. We discuss how AI and radiomics could be used to detect and characterize cancers and assess therapy response.

AB Some scientific researches have been conducted recently based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve animal welfare and health related problems. However, no review study was conducted to assess the potential of AI in solving the diverse application problems in several animal species including ruminants, pig and poultry. To fill in this gap, this paper provides a systematic review on scientific research advancement in AI related animal farming based on 131 research publications over the past four decades. It was shown that the number of related studies has increased significantly since 2016, and the most intensive studies were focused on animal behavior detection and recognition, and concentrated mostly on farm animal species of pig (37.95%), cattle (37.44%), and poultry (16.92%); Also, most scientific research in animal farming driven by sensors and AI models were focused on data collection, processing, assessment, and analysis in the areas of animal behavior detection, disease monitoring, growth estimation, and environment monitoring at the experimental stage; Moreover, some technical challenges on AI like the accuracy and cost need to be improved before it could come into use in the commercial animal farming.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to mimic human cognitive functions. It is bringing a paradigm shift to healthcare, powered by increasing availability of healthcare data and rapid progress of analytics techniques. We survey the current status of AI applications in healthcare and discuss its future. AI can be applied to various types of healthcare data (structured and unstructured). Popular AI techniques include machine learning methods for structured data, such as the classical support vector machine and neural network, and the modern deep learning, as well as natural language processing for unstructured data. Major disease areas that use AI tools include cancer, neurology and cardiology. We then review in more details the AI applications in stroke, in the three major areas of early detection and diagnosis, treatment, as well as outcome prediction and prognosis evaluation. We conclude with discussion about pioneer AI systems, such as IBM Watson, and hurdles for real-life deployment of AI.

AB Green communications have always been a target for the information industry to alleviate energy overhead and reduce fossil fuel usage. In the current 5G and future 6G eras, there is no doubt that the volume of network infrastructure and the number of connected terminals will keep exponentially increasing, which results in the surging energy cost. It becomes growing important and urgent to drive the development of green communications. However, there is no doubt that 6G will have increasingly stringent and diversified requirements for Quality of Service (QoS), security, flexibility, and intelligence, all of which challenge the improvement of energy efficiency. Moreover, the dynamic energy harvesting process, which will be widely adopted in 6G, further complicates the power control and network management. To address these challenges and reduce human intervention, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively recognized and acknowledged as the only solution. Academia and industry have conducted extensive research to alleviate energy demand, improve energy efficiency, and manage energy harvesting in various communication scenarios. In this paper, we present main considerations for green communications and survey related research on AI-based green communications. We focus on how AI techniques are adopted to manage networks and improve energy efficiency towards the green era. We analyze how Machine Learning (ML) techniques including state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) can cooperate with conventional AI methods and mathematical models to reduce the algorithm complexity and improve the accuracy rate in 6G. Finally, we discuss the existing problems and envision the open research issues of AI models towards green 6G.

AB Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 aca-demic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled health-care benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to signifi-cantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients' map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the catego-ries of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS; INNOVATION
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is becoming increasingly important, given its potential to generate and analyse healthcare data to improve patient care and reduce costs and clinical risk while enhancing administrative processes within organisations. AI can introduce new sources of growth, change how people work and improve the effectiveness of their work. Consequently, implementing AI systems in healthcare can enable the optimisation of healthcare resources, facilitate a better patient experience, improve population health, reduce per capita costs, and improve the satisfaction of health professionals. Nowadays, most studies have focused on the potential benefits and barriers to implementing AI in healthcare, while only a few have explained the rational decision-making process for deploying new technologies in the healthcare system. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating how AI supports the effective and efficient management of the healthcare system by examining the Humber River Hospital in Toronto using the case study methodology. To achieve the desired benefits from the process of implementing technology in healthcare, our key findings show that hospitals need to undergo a business transformation that exploits technology. Finally, we conclude that only effective knowledge of tech-nology will enable hospitals to effectively become technological and digital.

AB Cities are increasingly turning towards specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities.

AB Thanks to the exponential growth in computing power and vast amounts of data, artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable developments in recent years, enabling it to be ubiquitously adopted in our daily lives. Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy. Finally, we show the standard approaches that are leveraged to deal with the mentioned challenges.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation in public administration is gaining momentum heralded by the hope of smart public services that are personalised, lean, and efficient. However, the use of AI in public administration is riddled with ethical tensions of fairness, transparency, privacy, and human rights. We call these AI tensions. The current literature lacks a contextual and processual understanding of AI adoption and diffusion in public administration to be able to explore such tensions. Previous studies have outlined risks, benefits, and challenges with the use of AI in public administration. However, a large gap remains in understanding AI tensions as they relate to public value creation. Through a systematic literature review grounded in public value management and the resource-based view of the firms, we identify technology-organisational-environmental (TOE) contextual variables and absorptive capacity as factors influencing AI adoption as discussed in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that outlines distinct AI tensions from an AI implementation and diffusion perspective within public administration. We develop a future research agenda for the full AI innovation lifecycle of adoption, implementation, and diffusion.

AB Because of its robust autonomous learning and ability to address complex problems, artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly demonstrated its potential to solve the challenges faced in drinking water treatment (DWT). AI technology provides technical support for the management and operation of DWT processes, which is more efficient than relying solely on human operations. AI-based data analysis and evolutionary learning mechanisms are capable of realizing water quality diagnosis, autonomous decision making and operation process optimization and have the potential to establish a universal process analysis and predictive model platform. This review briefly introduces AI technologies that are widely used in DWT. Moreover, this paper reviews in detail the mature applications and latest discoveries of AI and machine learning technologies in the fields of source water quality, coagulation/flocculation, disinfection and membrane filtration, including source water contaminant monitoring and identification, accurate and efficient prediction of coagulation dosage, analysis of the formation of disinfection by-products and advanced control of membrane fouling. Finally, the challenges facing AI technologies and the issues that need further study are discussed; these challenges can be briefly summarized as a) obtaining more effective characterization data to screen and identify targeted contaminants in the complex background with the assistance of AI technologies and b) establishing a macro intelligence model and decision scheme for entire drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) to support the management of the water supply system.

AB Geotechnical engineering deals with soils and rocks and their use in engineering constructions. By their nature, soils and rocks exhibit complex behaviours and a high level of uncertainty in material modelling. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed and used by an increasing number of researchers in the field of geotechnical engineering in the last three decades. These methods have been considered successful due to their ability to predict complex nonlinear relationships. Based on more than one thousand (i.e. 1235) published literatures, this paper presents a detailed review of the performance of AI methods and algorithms used in geotechnical engineering. Nine key areas where the application of AI methods is prominent were identified: frozen soils and soil thermal properties, rock mechanics, subgrade soil and pavements, landslide and soil liquefaction, slope stability, shallow and piles foundations, tunnelling and tunnel boring machine, dams, and unsaturated soils. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emerged as the most widely used and preferred AI method with 52% of studies relying on it. Other methods that were used to a lesser extent were FIS, ANFIS, SVM, LSTM, CNN, ResNet and GAN. The analysis shows that the success and accuracy of AI applications depends on the number and type of datasets and selection of input parameters. The paper also provides statistical information on research incorporating AI methods and discusses the opportunities and challenges for future research and practical applications in geotechnical engineering.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping cancer research and personalized clinical care. Availability of high-dimensionality datasets coupled with advances in high-performance computing, as well as innovative deep learning architectures, has led to an explosion of AI use in various aspects of oncology research. These applications range from detection and classification of cancer, to molecular characterization of tumors and their microenvironment, to drug discovery and repurposing, to predicting treatment outcomes for patients. As these advances start penetrating the clinic, we foresee a shifting paradigm in cancer care becoming strongly driven by AI.
   Significance: AI has the potential to dramatically affect nearly all aspects of oncology-from enhancing diagnosis to personalizing treatment and discovering novel anticancer drugs. Here, we review the recent enormous progress in the application of AI to oncology, highlight limitations and pitfalls, and chart a path for adoption of AI in the cancer clinic.

AB As the computing paradigm shifts from cloud computing to end-edge-cloud computing, it also supports artificial intelligence evolving from a centralized manner to a distributed one. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) empowered by end-edge-cloud computing (EECC), where the heterogeneous capabilities of on-device computing, edge computing, and cloud computing are orchestrated to satisfy the diverse requirements raised by resource-intensive and distributed AI computation. Particularly, we first introduce several mainstream computing paradigms and the benefits of the EECC paradigm in supporting distributed AI, as well as the fundamental technologies for distributed AI. We then derive a holistic taxonomy for the state-of-the-art optimization technologies that are empowered by EECC to boost distributed training and inference, respectively. After that, we point out security and privacy threats in DAI-EECC architecture and review the benefits and shortcomings of each enabling defense technology in accordance with the threats. Finally, we present some promising applications enabled by DAI-EECC and highlight several research challenges and open issues toward immersive performance acquisition.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gathered attention with the release of ChatGPT, a user-centered chatbot released by OpenAI. In this perspective article, we retrace the evolution of LLMs to understand the revolution brought by ChatGPT in the artificial intelligence (AI) field.The opportunities offered by LLMs in supporting scientific research are multiple and various models have already been tested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in this domain.The impact of ChatGPT has been huge for the general public and the research community, with many authors using the chatbot to write part of their articles and some papers even listing ChatGPT as an author. Alarming ethical and practical challenges emerge from the use of LLMs, particularly in the medical field for the potential impact on public health. Infodemic is a trending topic in public health and the ability of LLMs to rapidly produce vast amounts of text could leverage misinformation spread at an unprecedented scale, this could create an "AI-driven infodemic," a novel public health threat. Policies to contrast this phenomenon need to be rapidly elaborated, the inability to accurately detect artificial-intelligence-produced text is an unresolved issue.

AB The use of nanomaterials in medicine depends largely on nanotoxicological evaluation in order to ensure safe application on living organisms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (MI) can be used to analyze and interpret large amounts of data in the field of toxicology, such as data from toxicological databases and high-content image-based screening data. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models and nano-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models can be used to predict the behavior and toxic effects of nanomaterials, respectively. PBPK and Nano-QSAR are prominent ML tool for harmful event analysis that is used to understand the mechanisms by which chemical compounds can cause toxic effects, while toxicogenomics is the study of the genetic basis of toxic responses in living organisms. Despite the potential of these methods, there are still many challenges and uncertainties that need to be addressed in the field. In this review, we provide an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in nanomedicine and nanotoxicology to better understand the potential toxic effects of these materials at the nanoscale.

AB Prognostication of outcome across multiple cancers and prediction of response to various treatment modalities are among the next generation of challenges that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can solve using radiology images. The authors of this Perspective describe the evolution of AI-based approaches in oncology imaging and address the path to their adoption as decision-support tools in the clinic.
   The successful use of artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnostic purposes has prompted the application of AI-based cancer imaging analysis to address other, more complex, clinical needs. In this Perspective, we discuss the next generation of challenges in clinical decision-making that AI tools can solve using radiology images, such as prognostication of outcome across multiple cancers, prediction of response to various treatment modalities, discrimination of benign treatment confounders from true progression, identification of unusual response patterns and prediction of the mutational and molecular profile of tumours. We describe the evolution of and opportunities for AI in oncology imaging, focusing on hand-crafted radiomic approaches and deep learning-derived representations, with examples of their application for decision support. We also address the challenges faced on the path to clinical adoption, including data curation and annotation, interpretability, and regulatory and reimbursement issues. We hope to demystify AI in radiology for clinicians by helping them to understand its limitations and challenges, as well as the opportunities it provides as a decision-support tool in cancer management.

AB Advances in personalization algorithms and other applications of machine learning have vastly enhanced the ease and convenience of our media and communication experiences, but they have also raised significant concerns about privacy, transparency of technologies and human control over their operations. Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human-AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences.

AB The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during a conference held on this subject. However, the possibility of machines being able to simulate human behavior and actually think was raised earlier by Alan Turing who developed the Turing test in order to differentiate humans from machines. Since then, computational power has grown to the point of instant calculations and the ability evaluate new data, according to previously assessed data, in real time.Today, AI is integrated into our daily lives in many forms, such as personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google assistant etc.), automated mass transportation, aviation and computer gaming. More recently, AI has also begun to be incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy, opening the path to providing better healthcare overall. Radiological images, pathology slides, and patients' electronic medical records (EMR) are being evaluated by machine learning, aiding in the process of diagnosis and treatment of patients and augmenting physicians' capabilities. Herein we describe the current status of AI in medicine, the way it is used in the different disciplines and future trends.

DT Article
AB In this paper, we present a multiple knowledge representation (MKR) framework and discuss its potential for developing big data artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with possible broader impacts across different AI areas. Typically, canonical knowledge representations and modern representations each emphasize a particular aspect of transforming inputs into symbolic encoding or vectors. For example, knowledge graphs focus on depicting semantic connections among concepts, whereas deep neural networks (DNNs) are more of a tool to perceive raw signal inputs. MKR is an advanced AI representation framework for more complete intelligent functions, such as raw signal perception, feature extraction and vectorization, knowledge symbolization, and logical reasoning. MKR has two benefits: (1) it makes the current AI techniques (dominated by deep learning) more explainable and generalizable, and (2) it expands current AI techniques by integrating MKR to facilitate the mutual benefits of the complementary capacity of each representation, e.g., raw signal perception and symbolic encoding. We expect that MKR research and its applications will drive the evolution of AI 2.0 and beyond.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to resolve real-world problems and has gained tremendous attention due to its applications in various fields. In recent years, AI techniques have also been employed in water treatment and desalination to optimize the process and to offer practical solutions to water pollution and water scarcity. Applications of AI is also expected to reduce the operational expenditures of the water treatment process by decreasing the cost and optimizing chemicals usage. This review summarizes various AI techniques and their applications in water treatment with a focus on the adsorption of pollutants. Numerous AI models have successfully predicted the performance of different adsorbents for the removal of numerous pollutants from water. This review also highlighted some challenges and research gap concerning applications of AI in water treatment. Despite several advantages offered by AI, there some limitations that hindered the widespread applications of these techniques in real water treatment systems. The availability and selection of data, poor reproducibility, less evidence of applications in real water treatment are some of the key challenges that need to be addressed. Recommendations are made to ensure the successful applications of AI in future waterrelated technologies. This review is beneficial for environmental researchers, engineers, students, and all stakeholders in the water industry.

AB The black-box nature of current artificial intelligence (AI) has caused some to question whether AI must be explainable to be used in high-stakes scenarios such as medicine. It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.

AB Automated decision making and predictive analytics through artificial intelligence, in combination with rapid progress in technologies such as sensor technology and robotics are likely to change the way individuals, communities, governments and private actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological change. Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors.

AB Recent years havewitnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning, a branch of AI that has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this article, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this article can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.

AB As online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has brought new ways for improving instruction and learning in online higher education. However, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying AI in the online higher education context. In addition, what AI algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. To fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of AI in online higher education. Specifically, this literature review examines the functions of AI in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. According to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. Results find that: (1) the functions of AI applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional AI technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by AI applications include a high quality of AI-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of AI-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students' academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. This systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into AI-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of AI applications in online higher education.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta-analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta-analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta-analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence.

AB Background and purpose Acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusions (LVOs) requires emergent detection and treatment by endovascular thrombectomy. However, radiologic LVO detection and treatment is subject to variable delays and human expertise, resulting in morbidity. Imaging software using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, may improve rapid frontline detection of LVO strokes. This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage, and characterizes LVO detection software.
   Methods A systematic review of acute stroke diagnostic-focused AI studies from January 2014 to February 2019 in PubMed, Medline, and Embase using terms: 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning or deep learning' and 'ischemic stroke' or 'large vessel occlusion' was performed.
   Results Variations of AI, including ML methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to detect LVO strokes. Twenty studies were identified that use ML. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) commonly used RFL, while LVO detection typically used CNNs. Image feature detection had greater sensitivity with CNN than with RFL, 85% versus 68%. However, AI algorithm performance metrics use different standards, precluding ideal objective comparison. Four current software platforms incorporate ML: Brainomix (greatest validation of AI for ASPECTS, uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs), General Electric, iSchemaView (largest number of perfusion study validations for thrombectomy), and V iz.ai (uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs, then automatically activates emergency stroke treatment systems).
   Conclusions AI may improve LVO stroke detection and rapid triage necessary for expedited treatment. Standardization of performance assessment is needed in future studies.

AB Membrane fouling is one of major obstacles in the application of membrane technologies. Accurately predicting or simulating membrane fouling behaviours is of great significance to elucidate the fouling mechanisms and develop effective measures to control fouling. Although mechanistic/mathematical models have been widely used for predicting membrane fouling, they still suffer from low accuracy and poor sensitivity. To overcome the limitations of conventional mathematical models, artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been proposed as powerful approaches to predict membrane filtration performance and fouling behaviour. This work aims to present a state-of-the-art review on the advances in AI algorithms (e.g., artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic programming, support vector machines and search algorithms) for prediction of membrane fouling. The working principles of different AI techniques and their applications for prediction of membrane fouling in different membrane-based processes are discussed in detail. Furthermore, comparisons of the inputs, outputs, and accuracy of different AI approaches for membrane fouling prediction have been conducted based on the literature database. Future research efforts are further highlighted for AI-based techniques aiming for a more accurate prediction of membrane fouling and the optimization of the operation in membrane-based processes.

AB In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.

AB The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has truly stimulated the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the transportation industry. Fueled by big data from various sensing devices and advanced computing resources, AI has become an essential component of AVs for perceiving the surrounding environment and making appropriate decision in motion. To achieve goal of full automation (i.e., self-driving), it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue. Specifically, it intends to analyze their use of AIs in supporting the primary applications in AVs: 1) perception; 2) localization and mapping; and 3) decision making. It investigates the current practices to understand how AI can be used and what are the challenges and issues associated with their implementation.

AB Artificial intelligence is disrupting the retail industry. Digital voice assistants as one of the most popular AI technologies are poised to revolutionize consumers' shopping journeys yet we have a sparse understanding of their role in fostering customer experience. The present study seeks to address this issue by proposing and validating a research model encompassing human-like attributes (i.e., perceived anthropomorphism, perceived animacy, and perceived intelligence), technology attributes (i.e., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived security), and contextual factors (i.e., social influence and facilitating conditions) as the antecedents to continuance usage of digital voice assistants to shop. The effects are facilitated by the formation of several perceptual-based outcomes such as parasocial interactions, smart-shopping perception, and AI-enabled customer experience. Data (n = 411) was collected through an online questionnaire-based survey and analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicated (i) all human-like and technology attributes, except effort expectancy, have a significant impact on parasocial interactions, (ii) perceived intelligence, perceived security, and performance expectancy significantly influence smart-shopping perception, (iii) parasocial interactions and smart-shopping perception foster AI-enabled customer experience, and (iv) AI enabled customer experience and social influence determine the continuance intention to shop using digital voice assistants. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to an implementation phase in many fields, including medicine. The combination of improved availability of large datasets, increasing computing power, and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5 years, AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition, caption generation, and speech recognition. Radiology, in particular, is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality, value, and depth of radiology's contribution to patient care and population health, and will revolutionize radiologists' workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice, policy, and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology, educational needs of members, research and development, partnerships, potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of radiologists, and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada.

AB Change detection based on remote sensing (RS) data is an important method of detecting changes on the Earth's surface and has a wide range of applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, agriculture investigation, disaster assessment, and map revision. In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI. This review will be beneficial for researchers in understanding this field.

AB In the context of the 4th industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental challenges, this study investigates the role of AI, robotics stocks and green bonds in portfolio diversification. Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification. The NASDAQ AI and general equity indexes are not good hedging instruments for each other.

AB Artificial intelligence technology is a rapidly expanding field with many applications in acute stroke imaging, including ischemic and hemorrhage subtypes. Early identification of acute stroke is critical for initiating prompt intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence can help with various aspects of the stroke treatment paradigm, including infarct or hemorrhage detection, segmentation, classification, large vessel occlusion detection, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score grading, and prognostication. In particular, emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as convolutional neural networks show promise in performing these imaging-based tasks efficiently and accurately. The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to describe AI methods and available public and commercial platforms in stroke imaging, and second, to summarize the literature of current artificial intelligence-driven applications for acute stroke triage, surveillance, and prediction.

AB This systematic review aims to investigate recent developments in the area of arc fault detection. The rising demand for electricity and concomitant expansion of energy systems has resulted in a heightened risk of arc faults and the likelihood of related fires, presenting a matter of considerable concern. To address this challenge, this review focuses on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in arc fault detection, with the objective of illuminating its advantages and identifying current limitations. Through a meticulous literature selection process, a total of 63 articles were included in the final analysis. The findings of this review suggest that AI plays a significant role in enhancing the accuracy and speed of detection and allowing for customization to specific types of faults in arc fault detection. Simultaneously, three major challenges were also identified, including missed and false detections, the restricted application of neural networks and the paucity of relevant data. In conclusion, AI has exhibited tremendous potential for transforming the field of arc fault detection and holds substantial promise for enhancing electrical safety.

AB Drug metabolism and excretion play crucial roles in determining the efficacy and safety of drug candidates, and predicting these processes is an essential part of drug discovery and development. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting drug metabolism and excretion, offering the potential to speed up drug development and improve clinical success rates. This review highlights recent advances in AI-based drug metabolism and excretion prediction, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms. We provide a list of public data sources and free prediction tools for the research community. We also discuss the challenges associated with the development of AI models for drug metabolism and excretion prediction and explore future perspectives in the field. We hope this will be a helpful resource for anyone who is researching in silico drug metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetic properties.

AB Over the last decade, the nanomedicine has experienced unprecedented development in diagnosis and management of diseases. A number of nanomedicines have been approved in clinical use, which has demonstrated the potential value of clinical transition of nanotechnology-modified medicines from bench to bedside. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in development of nanotechnology-based products could transform the healthcare sector by realizing acquisition and analysis of large datasets, and tailoring precision nanomedicines for cancer management. AI-enabled nanotechnology could improve the accuracy of molecular profiling and early diagnosis of patients, and optimize the design pipeline of nanomedicines by tuning the properties of nanomedicines, achieving effective drug synergy, and decreasing the nanotoxicity, thereby, enhancing the targetability, personalized dosing and treatment potency of nanomedicines. Herein, the advances in AI-enabled nanomedicines in cancer management are elaborated and their application in diagnosis, monitoring and therapy as well in precision medicine development is discussed.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and people's interactions with it-through virtual agents, socialbots, and language-generation software-do not fit neatly into paradigms of communication theory that have long focused on human-human communication. To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology, this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human-machine communication (HMC). Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.

AB Monkeypox or Mpox is an infectious virus predominantly found in Africa. It has spread to many countries since its latest outbreak. Symptoms such as headaches, chills, and fever are observed in humans. Lumps and rashes also appear on the skin (similar to smallpox, measles, and chickenpox). Many artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for accurate and early diagnosis. In this work, we systematically reviewed recent studies that used AI for mpox-related research. After a literature search, 34 studies fulfilling prespecified criteria were selected with the following subject categories: diagnostic testing of mpox, epidemiological modeling of mpox infection spread, drug and vaccine discovery, and media risk management. In the beginning, mpox detection using AI and various modalities was described. Other applications of ML and DL in mitigating mpox were categorized later. The various machine and deep learning algorithms used in the studies and their performance were discussed. We believe that a state-of-the-art review will be a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists in developing measures to counter the mpox virus and its spread.

AB Big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) technologies have attracted increasing interest in recent years from academics and practitioners. However, few empirical studies have investigated the benefits of BDA-AI in the supply chain integration process and its impact on environmental performance. To fill this gap, we extended the organizational information processing theory by integrating BDA-AI and positioning digital learning as a moderator of the green supply chain process. We developed a conceptual model to test a sample of data from 168 French hospitals using a partial least squares regression-based structural equation modeling method. The findings showed that the use of BDA-AI technologies has a significant effect on environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration. The study also underlined that both environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration have a significant impact on environmental performance. The results highlight the moderating role of green digital learning in the relationships between BDA-AI and green supply chain collaboration, a major finding that has not been highlighted in the extant literature. This article provides valuable insight for logistics/supply chain managers, helping them in mobilizing BDA-AI technologies for supporting green supply processes and enhancing environmental performance.

AB With the rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as diversified applications (e.g., virtual and augmented reality, remote surgery and holographic projection) with colorful requirements, current networks (e.g., 4G and upcoming 5G networks) may not be able to completely meet quickly rising traffic demands. Accordingly, efforts from both industry and academia have already been put to the research on 6G networks. Recently, artificial intelligence (Ai) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of 6G networks with a high level of intelligence. Therefore, this article proposes an Ai-enabled intelligent architecture for 6G networks to realize knowledge discovery, smart resource management, automatic network adjustment and intelligent service provisioning, where the architecture is divided into four layers: intelligent sensing layer, data mining and analytics layer, intelligent control layer and smart application layer. We then review and discuss the applications of Ai techniques for 6G networks and elaborate how to employ the Ai techniques to efficiently and effectively optimize the network performance, including Ai-empowered mobile edge computing, intelligent mobility and handover management, and smart spectrum management. We highlight important future research directions and potential solutions for Ai-enabled intelligent 6G networks, including computation efficiency, algorithms robustness, hardware development and energy management.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as a recently emerging technology, enabled a new breed of unprecedented applications in different domains. This technology's ongoing trend is departing from large remotely-controlled drones to networks of small autonomous drones to collectively complete intricate tasks time and costeffectively. An important challenge is developing efficient sensing, communication, and control algorithms that can accommodate the requirements of highly dynamic UAV networks with heterogeneous mobility levels. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning-based networking has gained momentum to harness the learning power of cognizant nodes to make more intelligent networking decisions by integrating computational intelligence into UAV networks. An important example of this trend is developing learning powered routing protocols, where machine learning methods are used to model and predict topology evolution, channel status, traffic mobility, and environmental factors for enhanced routing. This paper reviews AI-enabled routing protocols designed primarily for aerial networks, including topology predictive and self-adaptive learning-based routing algorithms, with an emphasis on accommodating highly dynamic network topology. To this end, we justify the importance and adaptation of AI into UAV network communications. We also address, with an AI emphasis, the closely related topics of mobility and networking models for UAV networks, simulation tools and public datasets, and relations to UAV swarming, which serve to choose the right algorithm for each scenario. We conclude by presenting future trends, and the remaining challenges in AI-based UAV networking, for different aspects of routing, connectivity, topology control, security and privacy, energy efficiency, and spectrum sharing.(1)

AB Autonomic computing investigates how systems can achieve (user) specified "control" outcomes on their own, without the intervention of a human operator. Autonomic computing fundamentals have been substantially influenced by those of control theory for closed and open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems may exhibit a number of concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge. The integration of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and self-management of systems can be achieved at different levels of granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop automation. In this article, leading academics, researchers, practitioners, engineers, and scientists in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum computing join to discuss current research and potential future directions for these fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing environments.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely explored across the world over the past decades. A particularly emerging topic is the application of AI in e-learning (AIeL) to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning in precision education. This study aims to systematically review publication patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals, countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in follow-up studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found that a majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning contexts. For field researchers, the visualized network diagram serves as a map to explore the invisible relationships among the core AIeL research, providing a structural understanding of AI-supported research in e-learning contexts. A further investigation of the follow-up studies behind the highly co-cited links revealed the extended research directions from the AIeL mainstreams, such as adaptive learning-based evaluation environments. Implications are discussed.

AB The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

AB Background/Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare sector is receiving attention from researchers and health professionals. Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field.

AB With the advancement of computational power, refinement of learning algorithms and architectures, and availability of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly with machine learning and deep learning, is paving the way for 'intelligent' healthcare systems. AI-related research in ophthalmology previously focused on the screening and diagnosis of posterior segment diseases, particularly diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. There is now emerging evidence demonstrating the application of AI to the diagnosis and management of a variety of anterior segment conditions. In this review, we provide an overview of AI applications to the anterior segment addressing keratoconus, infectious keratitis, refractive surgery, corneal transplant, adult and paediatric cataracts, angle-closure glaucoma and iris tumour, and highlight important clinical considerations for adoption of AI technologies, potential integration with telemedicine and future directions.

AB There is an exponential growth of the use of AI applications in organisations. Due to the machine learning capability of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, it is critical that such systems are used continuously in order to generate rich use data that allow them to learn, evolve and mature into a better fit for their user and organisational context. This research focuses on the actual use of conversational AI, in particular AI chatbot, as one type of workplace AI application to answer the research question: how do employees experience the use of an AI chatbot in their day-to-day work? Through a qualitative case study of a large international organisation and by performing an inductive analysis, the research uncovers the different ways in which users appropriate the AI chatbot and identifies two key dimensions that determine their type of use: the dominant mode of interaction and the understanding of the AI chatbot technology. Based on these dimensions, a taxonomy of users is presented, which classifies users of AI chatbots into four types: early quitters, pragmatics, progressives, and persistents. The findings contribute to the understanding of how conversational AI, particularly AI chatbots, is used in organisations and pave the way for further research in this regard. The implications for practice are also discussed.

AB Adequate clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms before adoption in practice is critical. Clinical evaluation aims to confirm acceptable AI performance through adequate external testing and confirm the benefits of AI-assisted care compared with conventional care through appropriately designed and conducted studies, for which prospective studies are desirable. This article explains some of the fundamental methodological points that should be considered when designing and appraising the clinical eval-uation of AI algorithms for medical diagnosis. The specific topics addressed include the following: (a) the importance of external testing of AI algorithms and strategies for conducting the external testing effectively, (b) the various metrics and graphical methods for evaluating the AI performance as well as essential methodological points to note in using and interpreting them, (c) paired study designs primarily for comparative performance evaluation of conventional and AI-assisted diagnoses, (d) parallel study designs primarily for evaluating the effect of AI intervention with an emphasis on randomized clinical trials, and (e) up-to-date guidelines for reporting clinical studies on AI, with an emphasis on guidelines registered in the EQUATOR Network library. Sound method-ological knowledge of these topics will aid the design, execution, reporting, and appraisal of clinical evaluation of AI.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support have been developed for clinical settings such as radiology, but little work evaluates the potential impact of such systems. In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.

AB Supply chain risk management (SCRM) encompasses a wide variety of strategies aiming to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor unexpected events or conditions which might have an impact, mostly adverse, on any part of a supply chain. SCRM strategies often depend on rapid and adaptive decision-making based on potentially large, multidimensional data sources. These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of supply chain literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches that fall within the AI spectrum. To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response). Finally, a comprehensive analysis of each category is provided to identify missing aspects and unexplored areas and propose directions for future research at the confluence of SCRM and AI.

AB Intelligent AI devices have become a common presence in the business landscape, offering a wide range of services, from the medical sector to the hospitality industry. From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.

AB PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used as a financial technology (fintech) in the mobile banking (M-banking) domain. However, in the literature, how AI affects users' perceptions of social support and the users' satisfaction and continuance intention (CI) remains unknown. To fill this gap, the two core characteristics of AI, perceived intelligence (PI) and perceived anthropomorphism (PA), are combined with social support theory (SST) (including informational support (IS) and emotional support (ES)) to develop a research model to investigate how PI and PA affect IS and ES, which in turn affect users' M-banking satisfaction and CI.Design/methodology/approachThis study adopted a random probability sampling method to collect a total of 360 valid responses to verify the proposed model. Partial least squares (PLS) was employed for data analysis.FindingsThe results showed that PI and PA both have a significant positive impact on consumers' perception of social support (IS and ES). IS was a direct driver of satisfaction and CI. Surprisingly, although ES was positively associated with satisfaction, the study found that higher levels of ES will decrease CI. This study exposed how AI affects consumers' satisfaction and CI through SST, and the role of AI in M-banking applications has been further confirmed.Originality/valueThis study expanded the SST to creatively integrate with AI features to reveal the impact of PI and PA on IS and ES, which in turn influence users' M-banking usage.

AB Manufacturing incumbents find it difficult to integrate AI in their traditional business models. This paper draws on the research question: How does manufacturing incumbents use AI for enabling business model innovation in industrial ecosystems? We use qualitative method in order to study four large global manufacturing incumbents that are transforming their business models with AI. We performed more than 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with strategic key personnel in order to understand how they have succeeded with implementing AI and transforming business models. Our main contribution establishes the need for AI business-model innovation to be aligned with ecosystem innovation. Specifically, in short-term incumbents may use ecosystem reconfiguration strategy, whereas long-term strategies relate to ecosystem revitalization, and resilience. Thus, we contribute by connecting organizational microelements with ecosystem macro dimensions and provide an evolutionary model envisioning how incumbents attempt to promote strategic transitions in their firms and ecosystems.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI mode ľs decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots can offer personalized, engaging, and on-demand health promotion interventions. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusions: AI chatbots have demonstrated the efficacy of health behavior change interventions among large and diverse populations; however, future studies need to adopt robust randomized control trials to establish definitive conclusions.

AB Food waste (FW) is a severe environmental and social concern that today's civilization is facing. Therefore, it is necessary to have an efficient and sustainable solution for managing FW bioprocessing. Emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are critical to achieving this, in which IoT sensors' data is analyzed using AI and ML techniques, enabling real-time decision-making and process optimization. This work describes recent developments in valorizing FW using novel tactics such as the IoT, AI, and ML. It could be concluded that combining IoT, AI, and ML approaches could enhance bioprocess monitoring and management for generating value-added products and chemicals from FW, contributing to improving environmental sustainability and food security. Generally, a comprehensive strategy of applying intelligent techniques in conjunction with government backing can minimize FW and maximize the role of FW in the circular economy toward a more sustainable future.

AB As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances technologically, it will inevitably bring many changes to classroom practices. However, research on AI in education reflects a weak connection to pedagogical perspectives or instructional approaches, particularly in K-12 education. AI technologies may benefit motivated and advanced students. Understanding the teacher's role of student motivation in mediating and supporting learning with AI technologies in the classroom is needed. This study used self-determination theory as the undergirding framework to investigate how teacher support moderates the effects of student expertise on needs satisfactions and intrinsic motivation to learn with AI technologies. This experimental study involved 123 Grade 10 students, and used chatbots as AI-based technologies in the experiment. The analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and competence to learn with the chatbot depended on both teacher support and student expertise (i.e. self-regulated learning and digital literacy), and the teacher support better satisfied the need for relatedness, and it less satisfied the need for autonomy. The findings refined our understanding about the application of self-determination theory and expand the pedagogical and design considerations of AI application and instructional practices.

AB Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Much research currently aims to improve AI technologies and debates their societal implications. Surprisingly little effort is spent on understanding the cognitive challenges of decision augmentation with AI-based systems although these systems make it more difficult for decision makers to evaluate the correctness of system advice and to decide whether to reject or accept it. As little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie such evaluations, we take an inductive approach to understand how AI advice influences physicians' decision-making process. We conducted experiments with a total of 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians who diagnosed patient cases with an AI-based system that provided both correct and incorrect advice. Based on qualitative data from think-aloud protocols, interviews, and questionnaires, we elicit five decision-making patterns and develop a process model of medical diagnosis decision augmentation with AI advice. We show that physicians use second order cognitive processes, namely metacognitions, to monitor and control their reasoning while assessing AI advice. These metacognitions determine whether physicians are able to reap the full benefits of AI or not. Specifically, wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers' own reasoning (self monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial information search. Our findings provide a first perspective on the metacognitive mechanisms that decision makers use to evaluate system advice. Overall, our study sheds light on an overlooked facet of decision augmentation with AI, namely, the crucial role of human actors in compensating for technological errors.

AB BackgroundThe growing application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has brought technological breakthroughs to traditional diagnosis and treatment, but it is accompanied by many risks and challenges. These adverse effects are also seen as ethical issues and affect trustworthiness in medical AI and need to be managed through identification, prognosis and monitoring.MethodsWe adopted a multidisciplinary approach and summarized five subjects that influence the trustworthiness of medical AI: data quality, algorithmic bias, opacity, safety and security, and responsibility attribution, and discussed these factors from the perspectives of technology, law, and healthcare stakeholders and institutions. The ethical framework of ethical values-ethical principles-ethical norms is used to propose corresponding ethical governance countermeasures for trustworthy medical AI from the ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects.ResultsMedical data are primarily unstructured, lacking uniform and standardized annotation, and data quality will directly affect the quality of medical AI algorithm models. Algorithmic bias can affect AI clinical predictions and exacerbate health disparities. The opacity of algorithms affects patients' and doctors' trust in medical AI, and algorithmic errors or security vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and harm to patients. The involvement of medical AI in clinical practices may threaten doctors 'and patients' autonomy and dignity. When accidents occur with medical AI, the responsibility attribution is not clear. All these factors affect people's trust in medical AI.ConclusionsIn order to make medical AI trustworthy, at the ethical level, the ethical value orientation of promoting human health should first and foremost be considered as the top-level design. At the legal level, current medical AI does not have moral status and humans remain the duty bearers. At the regulatory level, strengthening data quality management, improving algorithm transparency and traceability to reduce algorithm bias, and regulating and reviewing the whole process of the AI industry to control risks are proposed. It is also necessary to encourage multiple parties to discuss and assess AI risks and social impacts, and to strengthen international cooperation and communication.

AB Purpose: To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system.
   Materials and Methods: An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements.
   Results: On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P =.002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P =.046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P =.06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P =.15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87).
   Conclusion: Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

AB Conventional wet laboratory testing, validations, and synthetic procedures are costly and time-consuming for drug discovery. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized their applications to drug discovery. Combined with accessible data resources, AI techniques are changing the landscape of drug discovery. In the past decades, a series of AI-based models have been developed for various steps of drug discovery. These models have been used as complements of conventional experiments and have accelerated the drug dis-covery process. In this review, we first introduced the widely used data resources in drug discovery, such as ChEMBL and DrugBank, followed by the molecular representation schemes that convert data into computer-readable formats. Meanwhile, we summarized the algorithms used to develop AI-based models for drug discovery. Subsequently, we discussed the applications of AI techniques in pharmaceutical analysis including predicting drug toxicity, drug bioactivity, and drug physicochemical property. Furthermore, we introduced the AI-based models for de novo drug design, drug-target structure prediction, drug-target interaction, and binding affinity prediction. Moreover, we also highlighted the advanced applica-tions of AI in drug synergism/antagonism prediction and nano-medicine design. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future perspectives on the applications of AI to drug discovery.

AB This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.

AB This study examines the current state of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology applications and their impact on the healthcare industry. In addition to a thorough review of the literature, this study analyzed several real-world examples of AI applications in healthcare. The results indicate that major hospitals are, at present, using AI-enabled systems to augment medical staff in patient diagnosis and treatment activities for a wide range of diseases. In addition, AI systems are making an impact on improving the efficiency of nursing and managerial activities of hospitals. While AI is being embraced positively by healthcare providers, its applications provide both the utopian perspective (new opportunities) and the dystopian view (challenges to overcome). We discuss the details of those opportunities and challenges to provide a balanced view of the value of AI applications in healthcare. It is clear that rapid advances of AI and related technologies will help care providers create new value for their patients and improve the efficiency of their operational processes. Nevertheless, effective applications of AI will require effective planning and strategies to transform the entire care service and operations to reap the benefits of what technologies offer.

AB Background/purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made deep inroads into dentistry in the last few years. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the development of AI applications that are widely employed in dentistry and evaluate their performance in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and predicting the prognosis of the treatment.
   Materials and methods: The literature for this paper was identified and selected by perform-ing a thorough search in the electronic data bases like PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science, and Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000eMarch 15, 2020).After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. Quality analysis was performed using QUA-DAS-2.
   Results: AI technologies are widely implemented in a wide range of dentistry specialties. Most of the documented work is focused on AI models that rely on convolutional neural net-works (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AI models have been used in detec-tion and diagnosis of dental caries, vertical root fractures, apical lesions, salivary gland diseases, maxillary sinusitis, maxillofacial cysts, cervical lymph nodes metastasis, osteopo-rosis, cancerous lesions, alveolar bone loss, predicting orthodontic extractions, need for or-thodontic treatments, cephalometric analysis, age and gender determination.
   Conclusion: These studies indicate that the performance of an AI based automated system is excellent. They mimic the precision and accuracy of trained specialists, in some studies it was found that these systems were even able to outmatch dental specialists in terms of per-formance and accuracy.

ID DRUGS
AB Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become the breakthrough technology most anticipated to have a transformative effect on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). This is partially driven by revolutionary advances in computational technology and the parallel dissipation of previous constraints to the collection/processing of large volumes of data. Meanwhile, the cost of bringing new drugs to market and to patients has become prohibitively expensive. Recognizing these headwinds, AI/ML techniques are appealing to the pharmaceutical industry due to their automated nature, predictive capabilities, and the consequent expected increase in efficiency. ML approaches have been used in drug discovery over the past 15-20 years with increasing sophistication. The most recent aspect of drug development where positive disruption from AI/ML is starting to occur, is in clinical trial design, conduct, and analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic may further accelerate utilization of AI/ML in clinical trials due to an increased reliance on digital technology in clinical trial conduct. As we move towards a world where there is a growing integration of AI/ML into R&D, it is critical to get past the related buzz-words and noise. It is equally important to recognize that the scientific method is not obsolete when making inferences about data. Doing so will help in separating hope from hype and lead to informed decision-making on the optimal use of AI/ML in drug development. This manuscript aims to demystify key concepts, present use-cases and finally offer insights and a balanced view on the optimal use of AI/ML methods in R&D.

AB Supply chain resilience (SCRes) and performance have become increasingly important in the wake of the recent supply chain disruptions caused by subsequent pandemics and crisis. Besides, the context of digitalization, integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in building SCRes and improving supply chain performance (SCP). The present study investigates the direct and indirect effects of AI, SCRes, and SCP under a context of dynamism and uncertainty of the supply chain. In doing so, we have conceptualized the use of AI in the supply chain on the organizational information processing theory (OIPT). The developed framework was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data was collected from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various sectors, and countries. Our findings suggest that while AI has a direct impact on SCP in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its information processing capabilities to build SCRes for long-lasting SCP. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on maximizing the benefits of AI capabilities to generate sustained SCP. The study could be further extended using a longitudinal investigation to explore more facets of the phenomenon.

AB Purpose: This study was done to explore the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the diagnosis and grouping of intraocular retinoblastoma (iRB). Methods: It was a retrospective observational study using AI and Machine learning, Computer Vision (OpenCV). Results: Of 771 fundus images of 109 eyes, 181 images had no tumor and 590 images displayed iRB based on review by two independent ocular oncologists (with an interobserver variability of < 1%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the trained AI model were 85%, 99%, 99.6%, and 67%, respectively. Of 109 eyes, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detection of RB by AI model were 96%, 94%, 97%, and 91%, respectively. Of these, the eyes were normal (n = 31) or belonged to groupA (n=1), B (n=22), C (n=8), D (n=23),and E (n=24) RB based on review by two independent ocular oncologists (with an interobserver variability of 0%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the trained AI model were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% for group A; 82%, 20 21 98%, 90%, and 96% for group B; 63%, 99%, 83%, and 97% for group C; 78%, 98%, 90%, and 94% for group D, and 92%, 91%, 73%, and 98% for group E, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our study, we conclude that the AI model for iRB is highly sensitive in the detection of RB with high specificity for the classification of iRB.

AB This study is the first to provide an integrated view on the body of knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) published in the marketing, consumer research, and psychology literature. By leveraging a systematic literature review using a data-driven approach and quantitative methodology (including bibliographic coupling), this study provides an overview of the emerging intellectual structure of AI research in the three bodies of literature examined. We identified eight topical clusters: (1) memory and computational logic; (2) decision making and cognitive processes; (3) neural networks; (4) machine learning and linguistic analysis; (5) social media and text mining; (6) social media content analytics; (7) technology acceptance and adoption; and (8) big data and robots. Furthermore, we identified a total of 412 theoretical lenses used in these studies with the most frequently used being: (1) the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; (2) game theory; (3) theory of mind; (4) theory of planned behavior; (5) computational theories; (6) behavioral reasoning theory; (7) decision theories; and (8) evolutionary theory. Finally, we propose a research agenda to advance the scholarly debate on AI in the three literatures studied with an emphasis on cross-fertilization of theories used across fields, and neglected research topics.

AB The wear of cutting tools, cutting force determination, surface roughness variations and other machining responses are of keen interest to latest researchers. The variations of these machining responses results in change in dimensional accuracy and productivity upto great extent. In addition, an excessive increase in wear leads to catastrophic consequences, exceeding the tool breakage. Therefore, this article discusses the online trend of modern approaches in tool condition monitoring while different machining operations. For this purpose, the effective use of new sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) is considered and followed during this holistic review work. The sensor systems used for monitoring tool wear are dynamometers, accelerometers, acoustic emission sensors, current and power sensors, image sensors, other sensors. These systems allow to solve the problem of automation and modeling of technological parameters of the main types of cutting, such as turning, milling, drilling and grinding. The modern artificial intelligence methods are considered, such as: Neural networks, Image recognition, Fuzzy logic, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, Bayesian Networks, Support vector machine, Ensembles, Decision and regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, Artificial Neural Network, Markov model, Singular Spectrum Analysis, Genetic algorithms. Discussions also includes the main advantages, disadvantages and prospects of using various AI methods for tool wear monitoring. Moreover, the problems and future directions of the main processing methods using AI models are also highlighted.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) products play a significant role in achieving environmental sustainability. These products can save various resources (e.g., energy, water), achieve cost savings, and manage waste better. However, understanding the determinants affecting the use of AI products and their impact on environmental sustainability is relatively low, specifically in developing countries. To fill this gap in the literature, this study develops a theoretical model by integrating two well-known theories, UTAUT and PMT, to explain the de- terminants influencing Generation Z use of AI products and their impact on environmental sustainability. The developed model was then evaluated using the PLS-SEM approach based on data collected from 562 respondents in Malaysia and Turkey. Although effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, perceived severity, response efficacy, and response costs are significant drivers of green behavior among Malaysian in- dividuals, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, perceived severity, response efficacy, and response costs are essential determinants among Turkish individuals. Interestingly, there is no significant difference between the importance of coping appraisals (i.e., self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response costs) among these two populations. The outcomes provide several contributions to the literature on AI and environmental sustainability and offer valuable insights for the practitioners, policymakers, and AI product developers.

AB Artificial Intelligence tools have attracted attention from the literature and business organizations in the last decade, especially by the advances in machine learning techniques. However, despite the great potential of AI technologies for solving problems, there are still issues involved in practical use and lack of knowledge as regards using AI in a strategic way, in order to create business value. In this context, the present study aims to fill this gap by: providing a critical literature review related to the integration of AI to organizational strategy; synthetizing the existing approaches and frameworks, highlighting the potential benefits, challenges and opportunities; presenting a discussion about future research directions. Through a systematic literature review, research articles were analyzed. Besides gaps for future studies, a conceptual framework is presented, discussed according to four sources of value creation: (i) decision support; (ii) customer and employee engagement; (iii) automation; and (iv) new products and services. These findings contribute to both theoretical and managerial perspectives, with extensive opportunities for generating novel theory and new forms of management practices.

AB In this Review, Friedman and colleagues summarize the use of artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.
   The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a ubiquitous and standardized test, is an example of the ongoing transformative effect of AI on cardiovascular medicine. Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person's age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.

AB An analysis of academic citations and references generated by the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot reveals the citations and references are in fact, fake. They are clearly generated by a predictive process rather than known facts. This suggests that early optimism regarding this technology for assisting in research could be misplaced, and that student misuse of the chatbot can be detected by the identification of fake citations and references. Despite these problems, the technology could have application in the writing of course materials for lower level undergraduate courses that do not necessarily require references. Subject matter expertise is required, however, to identify and remove incorrect information. The need to identify incorrect information provided by an AI chatbot is a skill that students will also increasingly need.

AB Objectives Map the current landscape of commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) software for radiology and review the availability of their scientific evidence. Methods We created an online overview of CE-marked AI software products for clinical radiology based on vendor-supplied product specifications (). Characteristics such as modality, subspeciality, main task, regulatory information, deployment, and pricing model were retrieved. We conducted an extensive literature search on the available scientific evidence of these products. Articles were classified according to a hierarchical model of efficacy. Results The overview included 100 CE-marked AI products from 54 different vendors. For 64/100 products, there was no peer-reviewed evidence of its efficacy. We observed a large heterogeneity in deployment methods, pricing models, and regulatory classes. The evidence of the remaining 36/100 products comprised 237 papers that predominantly (65%) focused on diagnostic accuracy (efficacy level 2). From the 100 products, 18 had evidence that regarded level 3 or higher, validating the (potential) impact on diagnostic thinking, patient outcome, or costs. Half of the available evidence (116/237) were independent and not (co-)funded or (co-)authored by the vendor. Conclusions Even though the commercial supply of AI software in radiology already holds 100 CE-marked products, we conclude that the sector is still in its infancy. For 64/100 products, peer-reviewed evidence on its efficacy is lacking. Only 18/100 AI products have demonstrated (potential) clinical impact.

AB AI systems offer organizations great benefits causing decision-makers to invest more in these systems. The ad-vantages of AI cannot be achieved without successful implementation. Thus, it is crucial to recognize the factors impacting the successful implementation of AI. It is also important to assess and rank these factors by their importance to assist decision-makers in implementing these systems and increasing the success rate. Due to its importance, scholars called for studies to expand our knowledge in this critical area. This paper identifies, ex-tracts, and assesses the most critical factors that influence the implementation of AI systems. This study identifies nineteen factors and categorizes them into four categories: organization, technology, process, and environment. The analytical hierarchy process is used to evaluate the factors and the categories. The analysis offers two types of results, at the category level and the level of the factors. The results indicate that technology is the most significant of the four categories. The results also suggest that ethics is the most crucial factor among all nineteen factors. The order of all factors and discussions of the implications of the findings for practice and research are presented in the paper.

AB Drug discovery and development are among the most important translational science activities that contribute to human health and wellbeing. However, the development of a new drug is a very complex, expensive, and long process which typically costs 2.6 billion USD and takes 12 years on average. How to decrease the costs and speed up new drug discovery has become a challenging and urgent question in industry. Artificial intelligence (AI) combined with new experimental technologies is expected to make the hunt for new pharmaceuticals quicker, cheaper, and more effective. We discuss here emerging applications of AI to improve the drug discovery process.

They generated 819 research questions. A subteam of 12 converged them to a research agenda comprising three design areas - Machine artifact, Collaboration, and Institution - and 17 dualities - significant effects with the potential for benefit or harm. The MaT research agenda offers a structure and archetypal research questions to organize early thought and research in this new area of study.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that utilizes machines to mimic intelligent human behavior. To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena.

AB The last decade witnessed increasingly rapid progress in self-driving vehicle technology, mainly backed up by advances in the area of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The objective of this paper is to survey the current state-of-the-art on deep learning technologies used in autonomous driving. We start by presenting AI-based self-driving architectures, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as the deep reinforcement learning paradigm. These methodologies form a base for the surveyed driving scene perception, path planning, behavior arbitration, and motion control algorithms. We investigate both the modular perception-planning-action pipeline, where each module is built using deep learning methods, as well as End2End systems, which directly map sensory information to steering commands. Additionally, we tackle current challenges encountered in designing AI architectures for autonomous driving, such as their safety, training data sources, and computational hardware. The comparison presented in this survey helps gain insight into the strengths and limitations of deep learning and AI approaches for autonomous driving and assist with design choices.

AB Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide some suggestions for future works. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite artificial intelligence (AI)'s significant growth, its "black box" nature creates challenges in generating adequate trust. Thus, it is seldom utilized as a standalone unit in IoT high-risk applications, such as critical industrial infrastructures, medical systems, financial applications, etc. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to help with this problem. However, designing appropriately fast and accurate XAI is still challenging, especially in numerical applications. Here, we propose a universal XAI model, named the transparency relying upon statistical theory (TRUST), which is model-agnostic, high performing, and suitable for numerical applications. Simply put, TRUST XAI models the statistical behavior of the AI's outputs in an AI-based system. Factor analysis is used to transform the input features into a new set of latent variables. We use mutual information (MI) to rank these variables and pick only the most influential ones on the AI's outputs and call them "representatives" of the classes. Then, we use multimodal Gaussian (MMG) distributions to determine the likelihood of any new sample belonging to each class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TRUST in a case study on cybersecurity of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) using three different cybersecurity data sets. As IIoT is a prominent application that deals with numerical data. The results show that TRUST XAI provides explanations for new random samples with an average success rate of 98%. Compared with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), a popular XAI model, TRUST is shown to be superior in the context of performance, speed, and the method of explainability. In the end, we also show how TRUST is explained to the user.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garter substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the. medical imaging life cycle from image exertion to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation proem for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most and research group industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, die preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which ate algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to mimic human thought processes, learning capacity, and knowledge storage. AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI), and, in particular, deep learning as a subcategory of AI, provides opportunities for the discovery and development of innovative drugs. Various machine learning approaches have recently (re)emerged, some of which may be considered instances of domain-specific AI which have been successfully employed for drug discovery and design. This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles, alongside some application notes, of the various machine learning algorithms, the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed, including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo drug design, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction, drug repurposing, and related aspects. Finally, several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized, with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design.

ID DATASET SHIFT
AB The exceptionally rapid development of highly flexible, reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is likely to usher in newfound capabilities in medicine. We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary to enable them. We expect that GMAI-enabled applications will challenge current strategies for regulating and validating AI devices for medicine and will shift practices associated with the collection of large medical datasets.

AB Personalized medicine refers to the tailoring of diagnostics and therapeutics to individuals based on one's biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, preven-tive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice.

AB In the past few months, several works were published in regards to the dynamics and early detection of COVID-19 via mathematical modeling and Artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this work is to provide the research community with comprehensive overview of the methods used in these studies as well as a compendium of available open source datasets in regards to COVID-19. In all, 61 journal articles, reports, fact sheets, and websites dealing with COVID-19 were studied and reviewed. It was found that most mathematical modeling done were based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models while most of the AI implementations were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on X-ray and CT images. In terms of available datasets, they include aggregated case reports, medical images, management strategies, healthcare workforce, demography, and mobility during the outbreak. Both Mathematical modeling and AI have both shown to be reliable tools in the fight against this pandemic. Several datasets concerning the COVID-19 have also been collected and shared open source. However, much work is needed to be done in the diversification of the datasets. Other AI and modeling applications in healthcare should be explored in regards to this COVID-19.

AB Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) presents many opportunities in the psychotherapeutic landscape-such as therapeutic support for people with mental health problems and without access to care. The adoption of CAI poses many risks that need in-depth ethical scrutiny. The objective of this paper is to complement current research on the ethics of AI for mental health by proposing a holistic, ethical, and epistemic analysis of CAI adoption. First, we focus on the question of whether CAI is rather a tool or an agent. This question serves as a framework for the subsequent ethical analysis of CAI focusing on topics of (self-) knowledge, (self-)understanding, and relationships. Second, we propose further conceptual and ethical analysis regarding human-AI interaction and argue that CAI cannot be considered as an equal partner in a conversation as is the case with a human therapist. Instead, CAI's role in a conversation should be restricted to specific functions.

AB This study is a review to the special issue on artificial intelligence (AI) methods for groundwater level (GWL) modeling and forecasting, and presents a brief overview of the most popular AI techniques, along with the bibliographic reviews of the experiences of the authors over past years, and the reviewing and comparison of the obtained results. Accordingly, 67 journal papers published from 2001 to 2018 were reviewed in the terms of the features and abilities of the modeling approaches, input data consideration, prediction time steps, data division, etc. From the reviewed papers it can be concluded that despite some weaknesses, if the AI methods properly be developed, they can successfully be used to simulate and forecast the GWL time series in different aquifers. Since some of the stages of the AI modeling are based on the experience or trial-and-error procedures, it is useful to review them in the special application on GWL modeling. Many partial and general results were achieved from the reviewed papers, which can provide applicable guidelines for researchers who want to perform similar works in this field. Several new ideas in the related area of research are also presented in this study for developing innovative methods and for improving the quality of the modeling.

AB Maintaining the stability of labor income share is a key foundation for optimizing the structure of income distribution. Based on Chinese macroeconomic data, this study constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model with production tasks and applies numerical simulation to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) development on labor income share. The results demonstrate that the influence direction of AI development on labor income share depends on the relative speed of machine replacement and new tasks. Mechanism analysis reveals that machine replacement makes the wage growth rate smaller than the labor productivity growth rate, causing a decline in labor income share; however, new tasks can offset this negative impact, and the faster the growth is, the more obvious this offsetting effect is. Further numerical simulation confirms the above. Our study extends the research on labor income share, providing a new approach for understanding the changing mechanism of labor income share in China.

AB Experts have suggested that the next few decades will herald the fourth industrial revolution. The fourth industrial revolution will be powered by digitization, information and communications technology, machine learning, robotics and artificial intelligence; and will shift more decision-making from humans to machines. The ensuing societal changes will have a profound impact on both personal selling and sales management research and practices. In this article, we focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and their impact on personal selling and sales management. We examine that impact on a small area of sales practice and research based on the seven steps of the selling process. Implications for theory and practice are derived.

AB The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is fraught with complex and difficult problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems. Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (Al-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on Al-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on Al-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on Al-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the AEC industry.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced.

AB Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.

AB Many industry sectors have been pursuing the adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) ideas and technologies, which promise to realize lean and just-in-time production through digitization and the use of smart machines. This shift is driven by technological advances, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, sensor networks and Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and the availability of large amounts of data that can be exploited by these technologies. However, the adoption of AI technologies for I4.0 varies considerably among industry sectors. This article complements broader reviews of I4.0 by examining the specific applications of IAI in several industry sectors, highlighting the issues and concerns encountered in and across different industry sectors, and discussing potential solutions that have been introduced along with op-portunities and challenges for adoption. In this article, we review the literature to identify common themes and concerns related to the adoption of AI technologies in the context of I4.0 in several industry sectors. AI solutions are discussed in the context of an AI adoption pipeline that spans data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation of results. Our findings indicate that although different industries share common issues, the adopted solutions are often specific to a particular industry sector, which may be difficult to transfer to other sectors. Moreover, industry sectors may pursue different adoption strategies due to varying experience and maturity of AI practices. These findings may inform managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in the adaptation of Industry 4.0 transformation in their respective industry sectors.

AB Importance Mammography screening currently relies on subjective human interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) advances could be used to increase mammography screening accuracy by reducing missed cancers and false positives. Objective To evaluate whether AI can overcome human mammography interpretation limitations with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic accuracy study conducted between September 2016 and November 2017, an international, crowdsourced challenge was hosted to foster AI algorithm development focused on interpreting screening mammography. More than 1100 participants comprising 126 teams from 44 countries participated. Analysis began November 18, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measurements Algorithms used images alone (challenge 1) or combined images, previous examinations (if available), and clinical and demographic risk factor data (challenge 2) and output a score that translated to cancer yes/no within 12 months. Algorithm accuracy for breast cancer detection was evaluated using area under the curve and algorithm specificity compared with radiologists' specificity with radiologists' sensitivity set at 85.9% (United States) and 83.9% (Sweden). An ensemble method aggregating top-performing AI algorithms and radiologists' recall assessment was developed and evaluated. Results Overall, 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 US women (952 cancer positive <= 12 months from screening) were used for algorithm training and validation. A second independent validation cohort included 166 & x202f;578 examinations from 68 & x202f;008 Swedish women (780 cancer positive). The top-performing algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.858 (United States) and 0.903 (Sweden) and 66.2% (United States) and 81.2% (Sweden) specificity at the radiologists' sensitivity, lower than community-practice radiologists' specificity of 90.5% (United States) and 98.5% (Sweden). Combining top-performing algorithms and US radiologist assessments resulted in a higher area under the curve of 0.942 and achieved a significantly improved specificity (92.0%) at the same sensitivity. Conclusions and Relevance While no single AI algorithm outperformed radiologists, an ensemble of AI algorithms combined with radiologist assessment in a single-reader screening environment improved overall accuracy. This study underscores the potential of using machine learning methods for enhancing mammography screening interpretation.
   Question How do deep learning algorithms perform compared with radiologists in screening mammography interpretation? Findings In this diagnostic accuracy study using 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 women from the United States and 166 & x202f;578 screening mammograms from 68 & x202f;008 women from Sweden, no single artificial intelligence algorithm outperformed US community radiologist benchmarks; including clinical data and prior mammograms did not improve artificial intelligence performance. However, combining best-performing artificial intelligence algorithms with single-radiologist assessment demonstrated increased specificity. Meaning Integrating artificial intelligence to mammography interpretation in single-radiologist settings could yield significant performance improvements, with the potential to reduce health care system expenditures and address resource scarcity experienced in population-based screening programs.
   This diagnostic accuracy study evaluates whether artificial intelligence can overcome human mammography interpretation limits with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms.

AB Digitalization has altered many assumptions underpinning research on innovation management. At the early innings of exploring how digital innovation management stands out, there is a need for further studies in this area. Previous research on how firms use artificial intelligence has distinguished between automation and augmentation of human activities. In this paper, we explore how firms implement artificial intelligence within research and development. Utilizing an international news database spanning 956 articles from 122 newspapers published in 2020, we find that artificial intelligence is primarily adopted to augment human activities (55%) within research and development, rather than to automate matters (11%). We observe differences across sectors where automation is more common in government, information and communication technology (ICT), and technology and software. Our systematic coding shows that artificial intelligence is primarily adopted for exploration research and development (64%), rather than exploitation (5%). Based on these findings, we conclude that research and development from artificial intelligence primarily focuses on novel markets and areas of operations, rather than enhancing existing product markets and activities. Moreover, it augments human labor rather than replaces it; hence, job losses related to artificial intelligence do not seem to be taking place within research and development.

AB In the past few decades, according to the rapid development of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also made significant progress in the medical field. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing yearly, especially in developing countries. This article reviews the latest progress in AI in diagnosing and treating CRC based on a systematic collection of previous literature. Most CRCs transform from polyp mutations. The computer-aided detection systems can significantly improve the polyp and adenoma detection rate by early colonoscopy screening, thereby lowering the possibility of mutating into CRC. Machine learning and bioinformatics analysis can help screen and identify more CRC biomarkers to provide the basis for non-invasive screening. The Convolutional neural networks can assist in reading histopathologic tissue images, reducing the experience difference among doctors. Various studies have shown that AI-based high-level auxiliary diagnostic systems can significantly improve the readability of medical images and help clinicians make more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Moreover, Robotic surgery systems such as da Vinci have been more and more commonly used to treat CRC patients, according to their precise operating performance. The application of AI in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has further improved the treatment and efficacy evaluation of CRC. In addition, AI represented by deep learning in gene sequencing research offers a new treatment option. All of these things have seen that AI has a promising prospect in the era of precision medicine.

AB Background Advances in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) are occurring rapidly and there is a growing discussion about managing its development. Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. Main body The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public-private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship. Conclusions We are currently in a familiar situation in which regulation and oversight risk falling behind the technologies they govern. Regulation should emphasize patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy improves polyp detection and characterization in colonoscopy. However, data from large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCT) in an asymptomatic population are lacking.METHODS: This multicenter RCT aimed to compare AI-assisted colonoscopy with conventional colonoscopy for adenoma detection in an asymptomatic population. Asymptomatic subjects 45-75 years of age undergoing colorectal cancer screening by direct colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test were recruited in 6 referral centers in Hong Kong, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Xiamen, and Beijing. In the AI-assisted colonoscopy, an AI polyp detection system (Eagle-Eye) with real-time notifica-tion on the same monitor of the endoscopy system was used. The primary outcome was overall adenoma detection rate (ADR). Secondary outcomes were mean number of adenomas per co-lonoscopy, ADR according to endoscopist's experience, and colonoscopy withdrawal time. This study received Institutional Review Board approval (CRE-2019.393).RESULTS: From November 2019 to August 2021, 3059 subjects were randomized to AI-assisted colo-noscopy (n = 1519) and conventional colonoscopy (n = 1540). Baseline characteristics and bowel preparation quality between the 2 groups were similar. The overall ADR (39.9% vs 32.4%; P < .001), advanced ADR (6.6% vs 4.9%; P = .041), ADR of expert (42.3% vs 32.8%; P < .001) and nonexpert endoscopists (37.5% vs 32.1%; P = .023), and adenomas per colonoscopy (0.59 +/- 0.97 vs 0.45 +/- 0.81; P < .001) were all significantly higher in the AI-assisted colonos-copy. The median withdrawal time (8.3 minutes vs 7.8 minutes; P = .004) was slightly longer in the AI-assisted colonoscopy group.CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter RCT in asymptomatic patients, AI-assisted colonoscopy improved overall ADR, advanced ADR, and ADR of both expert and nonexpert attending endoscopists.

AB The expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein or gene transcripts is critical for therapeutic decision making in breast cancer. We examined the performance of a digitalized and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflow for HER2 status determination in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Our preliminary cohort consisted of 495 primary breast carcinomas, and our study cohort included 67 primary breast carcinomas and 30 metastatic deposits, which were evaluated for HER2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Three practicing breast pathologists independently assessed and scored slides, building the ground truth. Following a washout period, pathologists were provided with the results of the AI digital image analysis (DIA) and asked to reassess the slides. Both rounds of assessment from the pathologists were compared to the AI results and ground truth for each slide. We observed an overall HER2 positivity rate of 15% in our study cohort. Moderate agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.59) was observed between the ground truth and AI on IHC, with most discrepancies occurring between 0 and 1+ scores. Inter-observer agreement amongst pathologists was substantial (Fleiss ' kappa 0.77) and pathologists' agreement with AI scores was 80.6%. Substantial agreement of the AI with the ground truth (Cohen ' s kappa 0.80) was detected on ISH-stained slides, and the accuracy of AI was similar for the primary and metastatic tumors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a combined HER2 IHC and ISH AI workflow, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.94 when assessed in accordance with the ASCO/CAP recommendations.

AB Diabetes is a global eye health issue. Given the rising in diabetes prevalence and ageing population, this poses significant challenge to perform diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening for these patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning and deep learning have been adopted by various groups to develop automated DR detection algorithms. This article aims to describe the state-of-art AI DR screening technologies that have been described in the literature, some of which are already commercially available. All these technologies were designed using different training datasets and technical methodologies. Although many groups have published robust diagnostic performance of the AI algorithms for DR screening, future research is required to address several challenges, for examples medicolegal implications, ethics, and clinical deployment model in order to expedite the translation of these novel technologies into the healthcare setting.

AB Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as the "fourth industrial revolution" with transformative and global implications, including in healthcare, public health, and global health. AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? Methods Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. Results Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusions The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.

AB Influenced by the great success of deep learning via cloud computing and the rapid development of edge chips, research in artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted to both of the computing paradigms, i.e., cloud computing and edge computing. In recent years, we have witnessed significant progress in developing more advanced AI models on cloud servers that surpass traditional deep learning models owing to model innovations (e.g., Transformers, Pretrained families), explosion of training data and soaring computing capabilities. However, edge computing, especially edge and cloud collaborative computing, are still in its infancy to announce their success due to the resource-constrained IoT scenarios with very limited algorithms deployed. In this survey, we conduct a systematic review for both cloud and edge AI. Specifically, we are the first to set up the collaborative learning mechanism for cloud and edge modeling with a thorough review of the architectures that enable such mechanism. We also discuss potentials and practical experiences of some on-going advanced edge AI topics including pretraining models, graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. Finally, we discuss the promising directions and challenges in this field.

AB The anthropomorphic characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a positive environment for self-regulated learning (SRL). The factors affecting adolescents' SRL through AI technologies remain unclear. Limited AI and disciplinary knowledge may affect the students' motivations, as explained by self-determination theory (SDT). In this study, we examine the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous technical (AI) and disciplinary (English) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot. Data were collected from 323 9th Grade students through a questionnaire and a test. The students completed an AI basic unit and then learned English with a conversational chatbot for 5 days. Confidence intervals were calculated to investigate the mediating effects. We found that students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot, and that satisfying the need for autonomy and competence mediated the relationships between both knowledge (AI and English) and SRL, but relatedness did not. The self-directed nature of SRL requires heavy cognitive learning and satisfying the need for autonomy and competence may more effectively engage young children in this type of learning. The findings also revealed that current chatbot technologies may not benefit students with relatively lower levels of English proficiency. We suggest that teachers can use conversational chatbots for knowledge consolidation purposes, but not in SRL explorations. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially support students' self-regulated learning (SRL) of disciplinary knowledge through chatbots.Needs satisfaction in Self-determination theory (SDT) can explain the directive process required for SRL.Technical and disciplinary knowledge would affect SRL with technologies. What this paper addsThis study examines the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous AI (technical) and English (disciplinary) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot.Students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot.Autonomy and competence were mediators, but relatedness was not. Implications for practice and/or policyTeachers should use chatbots for knowledge consolidation rather than exploration.Teachers should support students' competence and autonomy, as these were found to be the factors that directly predicted SRL.School leaders and teacher educators should include the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in professional development programmes for digital education.

ID DECISIONS
AB Background Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the "Principles of Biomedical Ethics" by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.

AB Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology.

AB Air over-pressure (AOp) is one of the products of blasting operations for rock fragmentation in open-pit mines. It can cause structural vibration, smash glass doors, adversely affect the surrounding environment, and even be fatal to humans. To assess its dangerous effects, seven artificial intelligence (AI) methods for predicting specific blast-induced AOp have been applied and compared in this study. The seven methods include random forest, support vector regression, Gaussian process, Bayesian additive regression trees, boosted regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural network (ANN). An empirical technique was also used to compare with AI models. The degree of complexity and the performance of the models were compared with each other to find the optimal model for predicting blast-induced AOp. The Deo Nai open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was selected as a case study where 113 blasting events have been recorded. Indicators used for evaluating model performances include the root-mean-square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results indicate that AI techniques provide better performance than the empirical method. Although the relevance of the empirical approach was acceptable (R-2 = 0.930) in this study, its error (RMSE = 7.514) is highly significant to guarantee the safety of the surrounding environment. In contrast, the AI models offer much higher accuracies. Of the seven AI models, ANN was the most dominant model based on RMSE, R-2, and MAE. This study demonstrated that AI techniques are excellent for predicting blast-induced AOp in open-pit mines. These techniques are useful for blasters and managers in controlling undesirable effects of blasting operations on the surrounding environment.

AB We examined the productivity effects of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, in the context of midlevel professional writing tasks. In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment.

AB The new human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate of-fers the opportunity to treat patients with HER2-low breast cancer. Distinguishing HER2 immu-nohistochemical (IHC) scores of 0 and 1+ is not only critical but also challenging owing to HER2 heterogeneity and variability of observers. In this study, we aimed to increase the interpretation accuracy and consistency of HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ evaluation through assistance from an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. In addition, we examined the value of our AI algorithm in evaluating HER2 IHC scores in tumors with heterogeneity. AI-assisted interpretation consisted of AI algo-rithms and an augmenting reality module with a microscope. Fifteen pathologists (5 junior, 5 midlevel, and 5 senior) participated in this multi-institutional 2-round ring study that included 246 infiltrating duct carcinoma cases that were not otherwise specified. In round 1, pathologists analyzed 246 HER2 IHC slides by microscope without AI assistance. After a 2-week washout period, the pathologists read the same slides with AI algorithm assistance and rendered the definitive results by adjusting to the AI algorithm. The accuracy of interpretation accuracy with AI assistance (0.93 vs 0.80), thereby the evaluation precision of HER2 0 and the recall of HER2 1+. In addition, the AI algorithm improved the total consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.542-0.812), especially in HER2 1+ cases. In cases with heterogeneity, accuracy improved significantly (0.68 to 0.89) and to a similar level as in cases without heterogeneity (accuracy, 0.97). Both accuracy and consistency improved more for junior pathologists than those for the midlevel and senior pathologists. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the accuracy and consistency of HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ evaluation and the accuracy of HER2 IHC eval-uation in breast cancers with heterogeneity can be significantly improved using AI-assisted interpretation.(c) 2022 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

AB Background and objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has branched out to various applications in health-care, such as health services management, predictive medicine, clinical decision-making, and patient data and diagnostics. Although AI models have achieved human-like performance, their use is still limited because they are seen as a black box. This lack of trust remains the main reason for their low use in practice, especially in healthcare. Hence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been introduced as a technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by explaining how the prediction is derived, thereby encouraging the use of AI systems in healthcare. The primary goal of this review is to provide areas of healthcare that require more attention from the XAI research community.Methods: Multiple journal databases were thoroughly searched using PRISMA guidelines 2020. Studies that do not appear in Q1 journals, which are highly credible, were excluded. Results: In this review, we surveyed 99 Q1 articles covering the following XAI techniques: SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, Fuzzy classifier, EBM, CBR, rule-based systems, and others.Conclusion: We discovered that detecting abnormalities in 1D biosignals and identifying key text in clini-cal notes are areas that require more attention from the XAI research community. We hope this is review will encourage the development of a holistic cloud system for a smart city.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Patients with fractures are a common emergency presentation and may be misdiagnosed at radiologic imaging. An increasing number of studies apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to fracture detection as an adjunct to clinician diagnosis.
   Purpose: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance in fracture detection between AI and clinicians in peer-reviewed publications and the gray literature (ie, articles published on preprint repositories).
   Materials and Methods: A search of multiple electronic databases between January 2018 and July 2020 (updated June 2021) was performed that included any primary research studies that developed and/or validated AI for the purposes of fracture detection at any imaging modality and excluded studies that evaluated image segmentation algorithms. Meta-analysis with a hierarchical model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity was used. Risk of bias was assessed by using a modified Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, or PROBAST, checklist.
   Results: Included for analysis were 42 studies, with 115 contingency tables extracted from 32 studies (55 061 images). Thirty-seven studies identified fractures on radiographs and five studies identified fractures on CT images. For internal validation test sets, the pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 88, 93) for AI and 91% (95% CI: 85, 95) for clinicians, and the pooled specificity was 91% (95% CI: 88, 93) for AI and 92% (95% CI: 89, 92) for clinicians. For external validation test sets, the pooled sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 84, 95) for AI and 94% (95% CI: 90, 96) for clinicians, and the pooled specificity was 91% (95% CI: 81, 95) for AI and 94% (95% CI: 91, 95) for clinicians. There were no statistically significant differences between clinician and AI performance. There were 22 of 42 (52%) studies that were judged to have high risk of bias. Meta-regression identified multiple sources of heterogeneity in the data, including risk of bias and fracture type.
   Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) and clinicians had comparable reported diagnostic performance in fracture detection, suggesting that AI technology holds promise as a diagnostic adjunct in future clinical practice. (C) RSNA, 2022

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants have become an essential part of our daily lives. Yet, little is known concerning what motivates students to use them in educational activities. Therefore, this research develops a theoretical model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with subjective norm, enjoyment, facilitating conditions, trust, and security to examine students' use of AI-based voice assistants for instructional purposes. The developed model was then validated based on data collected from 300 university students using the PLS-SEM technique. The results supported the role of enjoyment, trust, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in affecting the perceived usefulness (PU) of voice assistants. The empirical results also showed that facilitating conditions and trust in technology strongly influence the PEOU. Contrary to the extant literature, the results indicated that subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and security did not impact PU. Similarly, subjective norm and enjoyment did not affect PEOU. This research is believed to add a holistic understanding of the key drivers affecting students' use of voice assistants for educational purposes. It offers several theoretical contributions and practical implications on how to successfully employ these assistants.

AB With the world-wide deployment of solar energy for a sustainable and renewable future, the stochastic and volatile nature of solar power pose significant challenges to the reliable, economic and secure operation of electrical energy systems. It is therefore imperative to improve the prediction accuracy of solar power to prepare for the unknown conditions in the future. So far, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning have been widely-reported with competitive prediction performance because they can reveal the invariant structure and nonlinear features in solar data. However, these reports have not been fully reviewed. Accordingly, this paper provides a taxonomy research of the existing solar power forecasting models based on AI algorithms. Taxonomy is a process of systematically dividing solar energy prediction methods, optimizers and prediction frameworks into several categories based on their differences and similarities. We also present the challenges and potential future research directions in solar power forecasting based on AI algorithms. This review can help scientists and engineers to theoretically analyze the characteristics of various solar prediction models, thereby helping them to select the most suitable model in any application scenario.

AB Empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are surging as new technologies with both business potential and customer pushback. This study exploits field experiment data on more than 6,200 customers who are randomized to receive highly structured outbound sales calls from chatbots or human workers. Results suggest that undisclosed chatbots are as effective as proficient workers and four times more effective than inexperienced workers in engendering customer purchases. However, a disclosure of chatbot identity before the machine-customer conversation reduces purchase rates by more than 79.7%. Additional analyses find that these results are robust to nonresponse bias and hang-ups, and the chatbot disclosure substantially decreases call length. Exploration of the mechanisms reveals that when customers know the conversational partner is not a human, they are curt and purchase less because they perceive the disclosed bot as less knowledgeable and less empathetic. The negative disclosure effect seems to be driven by a subjective human perception against machines, despite the objective competence of AI chatbots. Fortunately, such negative impact can be mitigated by a late disclosure timing strategy and customer prior AI experience. These findings offer useful implications for chatbot applications, customer targeting, and advertising in conversational commerce.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning models has been widely applied in numerous domains, including medical imaging and healthcare tasks. In the medical field, any judgment or decision is fraught with risk. A doctor will carefully judge whether a patient is sick before forming a reasonable explanation based on the patient's symptoms and/or an examination. Therefore, to be a viable and accepted tool, AI needs to mimic human judgment and interpretation skills. Specifically, explainable AI (XAI) aims to explain the information behind the black-box model of deep learning that reveals how the decisions are made. This paper provides a survey of the most recent XAI techniques used in healthcare and related medical imaging applications. We summarize and categorize the XAI types, and highlight the algorithms used to increase interpretability in medical imaging topics. In addition, we focus on the challenging XAI problems in medical applications and provide guidelines to develop better interpretations of deep learning models using XAI concepts in medical image and text analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides future directions to guide developers and researchers for future prospective investigations on clinical topics, particularly on applications with medical imaging.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) currently represents the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with incidence and mortality rates that are increasing. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of HCC clinical care, by improving HCC risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognostication. AI approaches include computational search algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. ML consists of a computer running repeated iterations of models, in order to progressively improve performance of a specific task, such as classifying an outcome. DL models are a subtype of ML, based on neural network structures that are inspired by the neuroanatomy of the human brain. A growing body of recent data now apply DL models to diverse data sources - including electronic health record data, imaging modalities, histopathology and molecular biomarkers - to improve the accuracy of HCC risk prediction, detection and prediction of treatment response. Despite the promise of these early results, future research is still needed to standardise AI data, and to improve both the generalisability and interpretability of results. If such challenges can be overcome, AI has the potential to profoundly change the way in which care is provided to patients with or at risk of HCC.

ID PREDICTION
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term referring to the application of computational algorithms that can analyze large data sets to classify, predict, or gain useful conclusions. Under the umbrella of AI is machine learning (ML). ML is the process of building or learning statistical models using previously observed real world data to predict outcomes, or categorize observations based on 'training' provided by humans. These predictions are then applied to future data, all the while folding in the new data into its perpetually improving and calibrated statistical model. The future of AI and ML in healthcare research is exciting and expansive. AI and ML are becoming cornerstones in the medical and healthcare-research domains and are integral in our continued processing and capitalization of robust patient EMR data. Considerations for the use and application of ML in healthcare settings include assessing the quality of data inputs and decision-making that serve as the foundations of the ML model, ensuring the end-product is interpretable, transparent, and ethical concerns are considered throughout the development process. The current and future applications of ML include improving the quality and quantity of data collected from EMRs to improve registry data, utilizing these robust datasets to improve and standardized research protocols and outcomes, clinical decision-making applications, natural language processing and improving the fundamentals of value-based care, to name only a few.

AB We are witnessing a fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it becomes dramatically challenging to explain AI models in the past decade. "Explanation" has a flexible philosophical concept of "satisfying the subjective curiosity for causal information", driving a wide spectrum of methods being invented and/or adapted from many aspects and communities, including machine learning, visual analytics, human-computer interaction and so on. Nevertheless, from the view-point of data and knowledge engineering (DKE), a best explaining practice that is cost-effective in terms of extra intelligence acquisition should exploit the causal information and explaining scenarios which is hidden richly in the data itself. In the past several years, there are plenty of works contributing in this line but there is a lack of a clear taxonomy and systematic review of the current effort. To this end, we propose this survey, reviewing and taxonomizing existing efforts from the view-point of DKE, summarizing their contribution, technical essence and comparative characteristics. Specifically, we categorize methods into data-driven methods where explanation comes from the taskrelated data, and knowledge-aware methods where extraneous knowledge is incorporated. Furthermore, in the light of practice, we provide survey of state-of-art evaluation metrics and deployed explanation applications in industrial practice.

AB This scoping review examines the contemporary applications of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software in orthodontics, focusing on its potential to improve daily working protocols, but also highlighting its limitations. The aim of the review was to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of current AI-based systems compared to conventional methods in diagnosing, assessing the progress of patients' treatment and follow-up stability. The researchers used various online databases and identified diagnostic software and dental monitoring software as the most studied software in contemporary orthodontics. The former can accurately identify anatomical landmarks used for cephalometric analysis, while the latter enables orthodontists to thoroughly monitor each patient, determine specific desired outcomes, track progress, and warn of potential changes in pre-existing pathology. However, there is limited evidence to assess the stability of treatment outcomes and relapse detection. The study concludes that AI is an effective tool for managing orthodontic treatment from diagnosis to retention, benefiting both patients and clinicians. Patients find the software easy to use and feel better cared for, while clinicians can make diagnoses more easily and assess compliance and damage to braces or aligners more quickly and frequently.

AB Purpose The aim of this systematic review was to analyse literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics, including all medical imaging modalities, for oncological and non-oncological applications, in order to assess how far the image mining research stands from routine medical application. To do this, we applied a trial phases classification inspired from the drug development process.
   Methods Among the articles we considered for inclusion from PubMed were multimodality AI and radiomics investigations, with a validation analysis aimed at relevant clinical objectives. Quality assessment of selected papers was performed according to the QUADAS-2 criteria. We developed the phases classification criteria for image mining studies.
   Results Overall 34,626 articles were retrieved, 300 were selected applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 171 high-quality papers (QUADAS-2 >= 7) were identified and analysed. In 27/171 (16%), 141/171 (82%), and 3/171 (2%) studies the development of an AI-based algorithm, radiomics model, and a combined radiomics/AI approach, respectively, was described. A total of 26/27(96%) and 1/27 (4%) AI studies were classified as phase II and III, respectively. Consequently, 13/141 (9%), 10/141 (7%), 111/141 (79%), and 7/141 (5%) radiomics studies were classified as phase 0, I, II, and III, respectively. All three radiomics/AI studies were categorised as phase II trials.
   Conclusions The results of the studies are promising but still not mature enough for image mining tools to be implemented in the clinical setting and be widely used. The transfer learning from the well-known drug development process, with some specific adaptations to the image mining discipline could represent the most effective way for radiomics and AI algorithms to become the standard of care tools.

AB The advent of machines powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technologies have already strongly influenced the hospitality industry, and the effects of its replacement upon the human workforce has been a highly debated topic. Despite this, empirical evidence in the form of published empirical studies have yet to appear in academic journals that present compelling evidence addressing what hospitality employees' awareness of those potential impacts could be pertaining to AI and robotics specifically applied within the context of their turnover intention and future employment prospects. The purpose of this study was to present new empirical findings on this issue using data from a sample of 468 full-time five star hotel employees in Guangzhou, China. AI and robotics awareness was found to be significantly associated with employee turnover intention. This relationship was moderated by perceived organizational support and competitive psychological climate. Implications and directions for future research are provided.

AB background Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly fuelling a fundamental transformation in the practice of pathology. However, clinical integration remains challenging, with no AI algorithms to date in routine adoption within typical anatomic pathology (AP) laboratories. This survey gathered current expert perspectives and expectations regarding the role of AI in AP from those with first-hand computational pathology and AI experience.Methods Perspectives were solicited using the Delphi method from 24 subject matter experts between December 2020 and February 2021 regarding the anticipated role of AI in pathology by the year 2030. The study consisted of three consecutive rounds: 1) an open-ended, free response questionnaire generating a list of survey items; 2) a Likert-scale survey scored by experts and analysed for consensus; and 3) a repeat survey of items not reaching consensus to obtain further expert consensus.Findings Consensus opinions were reached on 141 of 180 survey items (78.3%). Experts agreed that AI would be routinely and impactfully used within AP laboratory and pathologist clinical workflows by 2030. High consensus was reached on 100 items across nine categories encompassing the impact of AI on (1) pathology key performance indicators (KPIs) and (2) the pathology workforce and specific tasks performed by (3) pathologists and (4) AP lab technicians, as well as (5) specific AI applications and their likelihood of routine use by 2030, (6) AI's role in inte-grated diagnostics, (7) pathology tasks likely to be fully automated using AI, and (8) regulatory/legal and (9) ethical aspects of AI integration in pathology.Interpretation This systematic consensus study details the expected short-to-mid-term impact of AI on pathology practice. These findings provide timely and relevant information regarding future care delivery in pathology and raise key practical, ethical, and legal challenges that must be addressed prior to AI's successful clinical implementation.

AB The energy industry is at a crossroads. Digital technological developments have the potential to change our energy supply, trade, and consumption dramatically. The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study's findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cutthroat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible.

AB With a ten-year horizon from concept to reality, it is time now to start thinking about what will the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications be on the eve of the fifth-generation (50) deployment. To pave the way for the development of 6G and beyond, we provide 6G visions in this paper. We first introduce the state-of-the-art technologies in 5G and indicate the necessity to study 6G. By taking the current and emerging development of wireless communications into consideration, we envision 6G to include three major aspects. namely, mobile ultra-broadband, super Internet-of-Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Then, we review key technologies to realize each aspect. In particular, teraherz (THz) communications can be used to support mobile ultra-broadband, symbiotic radio and satellite-assisted communications can be used to achieve super IoT, and machine learning techniques are promising candidates for AI. For each technology, we provide the basic principle, key challenges. and state-of-the-art approaches and solutions.

ID CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA
AB BCR-ABL1 is a fusion protein as a result of a unique chromosomal translocation (producing the so-called Philadelphia chromosome) that serves as a clinical biomarker primarily for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); the Philadelphia chromosome also occurs, albeit rather rarely, in other types of leukemia. This fusion protein has proven itself to be a promising therapeutic target. Exploiting the natural vitamin E molecule gamma-tocotrienol as a BCR-ABL1 inhibitor with deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) drug design, this study aims to overcome the present toxicity that embodies the currently provided medications for (Ph+) leukemia, especially asciminib. Gamma-tocotrienol was employed in an AI server for drug design to construct three effective de novo drug compounds for the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. The AIGT's (Artificial Intelligence Gamma-Tocotrienol) drug-likeliness analysis among the three led to its nomination as a target possibility. The toxicity assessment research comparing AIGT and asciminib demonstrates that AIGT, in addition to being more effective nonetheless, is also hepatoprotective. While almost all CML patients can achieve remission with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as asciminib), they are not cured in the strict sense. Hence it is important to develop new avenues to treat CML. We present in this study new formulations of AIGT. The docking of the AIGT with BCR-ABL1 exhibited a binding affinity of -7.486 kcal/mol, highlighting the AIGT's feasibility as a pharmaceutical option. Since current medical care only exclusively cures a small number of patients of CML with utter toxicity as a pressing consequence, a new possibility to tackle adverse instances is therefore presented in this study by new formulations of natural compounds of vitamin E, gamma-tocotrienol, thoroughly designed by AI. Even though AI-designed AIGT is effective and adequately safe as computed, in vivo testing is mandatory for the verification of the in vitro results.

ID VALIDATION
AB Objective: To evaluate the design characteristics of studies that evaluated the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the diagnostic analysis of medical images.
   Materials and Methods: PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals
   Results: Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals.
   Conclusion: Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.

AB Objective: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have been reported in several cardiovascular diseases but its interest in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) has been so far less reported. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge on applications of AI in patients with PAD, to discuss current limits, and highlight perspectives in the field.
   Methods: We performed a narrative review based on studies reporting applications of AI in patients with PAD. The MEDLINE database was independently searched by two authors using a combination of keywords to identify studies published between January 1995 and December 2021. Three main fields of AI were investigated including natural lan-guage processing (NLP), computer vision and machine learning (ML).
   Results: NLP and ML brought new tools to improve the screening, the diagnosis and classification of the severity of PAD. ML was also used to develop predictive models to better assess the prognosis of patients and develop real-time pre-diction models to support clinical decision-making. Studies related to computer vision mainly aimed at creating auto-matic detection and characterization of arterial lesions based on Doppler ultrasound examination or computed tomography angiography. Such tools could help to improve screening programs, enhance diagnosis, facilitate presur-gical planning, and improve clinical workflow.
   Conclusions: AI offers various applications to support and likely improve the management of patients with PAD. Further research efforts are needed to validate such applications and investigate their accuracy and safety in large multinational cohorts before their implementation in daily clinical practice.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and exposed weak links in the chains far beyond what most people have witnessed in their living memory. The scale of disruption affects every nation and industry, and the sudden and dramatic changes in demand and supply that have occurred during the pandemic crisis clearly differentiate its impact from other crises. Using the dynamic capabilities view, we studied alliance management capability (AMC) and artificial intelligence (AI) driven supply chain analytics capability (AI-SCAC) as dynamic capabilities, under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. We tested our four research hypotheses using survey data collected from the Indian auto components manufacturing industry. For data analysis we used Warp PLS 7.0 (a variance-based structural equation modelling tool). We found that alliance management capability under the mediating effect of artificial intelligence-powered supply chain analytics capability enhances the operational and financial performance of the organization. Moreover, we also observed that the alliance management capability has a significant effect on artificial intelligence-powered supply chain analytics capability under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. The results of our study provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamic capabilities and the relational view of organization. Finally, we noted the limitations of our study and provide numerous research directions that may help answer some of the questions that arise from our study.

AB The importance of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning has been at the forefront of research for operations and supply chain management. Literature has reported the influence of big data analytics for improved operational performance, but there has been a paucity of research regarding the role of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on the adoption of big data analytics. To address this gap, we draw on the dynamic capabilities view of firms and on contingency theory to develop and test a model that describes the role of EO on the adoption of big data analytics powered by artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and operational performance (OP). We tested our research hypotheses using a survey of 256 responses gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire from manufacturing firms in India with the help of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). The results from our analysis indicate that EO enables an organisation to exploit and further explore the BDA-AI capabilities to achieve superior OP. Further, our results provide empirical evidence based on data analysis that EO is strongly associated with higher order capabilities (such as BDA-AI) and OP under differential effects of environmental dynamism (ED). These findings extend the dynamic capability view and contingency theory to create better understanding of dynamic capabilities of the organisation while also providing theoretically grounded guidance to the managers to align their EO with their technological capabilities within their firms.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) demands the rapid development of domain-specific hardware specifically designed for AI applications. Neuro-inspired computing chips integrate a range of features inspired by neurobiological systems and could provide an energy-efficient approach to AI computing workloads. Here, we review the development of neuro-inspired computing chips, including artificial neural network chips and spiking neural network chips. We propose four key metrics for benchmarking neuro-inspired computing chips - computing density, energy efficiency, computing accuracy, and on-chip learning capability - and discuss co-design principles, from the device to the algorithm level, for neuro-inspired computing chips based on non-volatile memory. We also provide a future electronic design automation tool chain and propose a roadmap for the development of large-scale neuro-inspired computing chips.
   This Review Article examines the development of neuro-inspired computing chips and their key benchmarking metrics, providing a co-design tool chain and proposing a roadmap for future large-scale chips.

AB Over the past decade, polypharmacy instances have been common in multi-diseases treatment. However, unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that might cause unexpected adverse drug events (ADEs) in multiple regimens therapy remain a significant issue. Since artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous today, many AI prediction models have been developed to predict DDIs to support clinicians in pharmacotherapy-related decisions. However, even though DDI prediction models have great potential for assisting physicians in polypharmacy decisions, there are still concerns regarding the reliability of AI models due to their black-box nature. Building AI models with explainable mechanisms can augment their transparency to address the above issue. Explainable AI (XAI) promotes safety and clarity by showing how decisions are made in AI models, especially in critical tasks like DDI predictions. In this review, a comprehensive overview of AI-based DDI prediction, including the publicly available source for AI-DDIs studies, the methods used in data manipulation and feature preprocessing, the XAI mechanisms to promote trust of AI, especially for critical tasks as DDIs prediction, the modeling methods, is provided. Limitations and the future directions of XAI in DDIs are also discussed. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB The emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has enhanced the lives of humans and envisioned the concept of smart cities using informed actions, enhanced user interpretations and explanations, and firm decision-making processes. The XAI systems can unbox the potential of black-box AI models and describe them explicitly. The study comprehensively surveys the current and future developments in XAI technologies for smart cities. It also highlights the societal, industrial, and technological trends that initiate the drive towards XAI for smart cities. It presents the key to enabling XAI technologies for smart cities in detail. The paper also discusses the concept of XAI for smart cities, various XAI technology use cases, challenges, applications, possible alternative solutions, and current and future research enhancements. Research projects and activities, including standardization efforts toward developing XAI for smart cities, are outlined in detail. The lessons learned from state-of-the-art research are summarized, and various technical challenges are discussed to shed new light on future research possibilities. The presented study on XAI for smart cities is a first-of-its-kind, rigorous, and detailed study to assist future researchers in implementing XAI-driven systems, architectures, and applications for smart cities.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have recently been radically improved and are now being employed in almost every application domain to develop automated or semi-automated systems. To facilitate greater human acceptability of these systems, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years with the development of highly accurate models but with a paucity of explainability and interpretability. The literature shows evidence from numerous studies on the philosophy and methodologies of XAI. Nonetheless, there is an evident scarcity of secondary studies in connection with the application domains and tasks, let alone review studies following prescribed guidelines, that can enable researchers' understanding of the current trends in XAI, which could lead to future research for domain- and application-specific method development. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the recent developments of XAI methods and evaluation metrics concerning different application domains and tasks. This study considers 137 articles published in recent years and identified through the prominent bibliographic databases. This systematic synthesis of research articles resulted in several analytical findings: XAI methods are mostly developed for safety-critical domains worldwide, deep learning and ensemble models are being exploited more than other types of AI/ML models, visual explanations are more acceptable to end-users and robust evaluation metrics are being developed to assess the quality of explanations. Research studies have been performed on the addition of explanations to widely used AI/ML models for expert users. However, more attention is required to generate explanations for general users from sensitive domains such as finance and the judicial system.

TI Artificial intelligence for polyp detection during colonoscopy: a

LA English
DT Review
ID CANCER; RISK
AB Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-based polyp detection systems are used during colonoscopy with the aim of increasing lesion detection and improving colonoscopy quality. Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials to determine the value of AI-based polyp detection systems for detection of polyps and colorectal cancer. We performed systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Independent reviewers screened studies and assessed eligibility, certainty of evidence, and risk of bias. We compared colonoscopy with and without AI by calculating relative and absolute risks and mean differences for detection of polyps, adenomas, and colorectal cancer. Results: Five randomized trials were eligible for analysis. Colonoscopy with AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given with 95%CI). ADR with AI was 29.6% (22.2%-37.0%) versus 19.3% (12.7%-25.9%) without AI; relative risk (RR] 1.52 (1.31-1.77), with high certainty. PDR was 45.4% (41.1%-49.8%) with AI versus 30.6% (26.5%-34.6%) without AI; RR 1.48 (1.37-1.60), with high certainty. There was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high certainty). Mean adenomas detected per colonoscopy was higher for small adenomas (<= 5mm) for AI versus non-AI (mean difference 0.15 [0.12-0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (>5-<= 10mm, mean difference 0.03 [0.01-0.05];>10mm, mean difference 0.01 [0.00-0.02]; high certainty). Data on cancer are unavailable. Conclusions: AI-based polyp detection systems during colonoscopy increase detection of small nonadvanced adenomas and polyps, but not of advanced adenomas.

AB Structure-based drug design is becoming an essential tool for faster and more cost-efficient lead discovery relative to the traditional method. Genomic, proteomic, and structural studies have provided hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. This situation poses a major problem: the necessity to handle the big data generated by combinatorial chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning play a pivotal role in the analysis and systemization of larger data sets by statistical machine learning methods. Advanced AI-based sophisticated machine learning tools have a significant impact on the drug discovery process including medicinal chemistry. In this review, we focus on the currently available methods and algorithms for structure-based drug design including virtual screening and de novo drug design, with a special emphasis on AI- and deep-learning-based methods used for drug discovery.

AB With the development of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), the era of big data-driven product design is booming. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) is also emerging and evolving by recent breakthroughs in computing power and software architectures. In this regard, the digital twin, analyzing various sensor data with the help of AI algorithms, has become a cutting-edge technology that connects the physical and virtual worlds, in which the various sensors are highly desirable to collect environmental information. However, although existing sensor technologies, including cameras, microphones, inertial measurement units, etc., are widely used as sensing elements for various applications, high-power consumption and battery replacement of them is still a problem. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as self-powered sensors supply a feasible platform for realizing self-sustainable and low-power systems. Herein, the recent progress on TENG-based intelligent systems, that is, wearable electronics, robot-related systems, and smart homes, followed by prospective future development enabled by sensor fusion technology, is focused on. Finally, how to apply artificial intelligence to the design of intelligent sensor systems for the 5G and IoT era is discussed.

AB At the beginning of the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) era, the expectations are high, and experts foresee that AI/ML shows potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of medical conditions. However, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies. Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10 (15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively. We have launched the first comprehensive and open access database of strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies that have been approved by the FDA. The database will be constantly updated.

AB Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.

AB The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education.

AB Precision oncology relies on the identification of targetable molecular alterations in tumor tissues. In many tumor types, a limited set of molecular tests is currently part of standard diagnostic workflows. However, universal testing for all targetable alterations, especially rare ones, is limited by the cost and availability of molecular assays. From 2017 to 2021, multiple studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) methods can predict the probability of specific genetic alterations directly from conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) tissue slides. Although these methods are currently less accurate than gold standard testing (e.g. immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing), they could be used as pre-screening tools to reduce the workload of genetic analyses. In this systematic literature review, we summarize the state of the art in predicting molecular alterations from H&E using AI. We found that AI methods perform reasonably well across multiple tumor types, although few algorithms have been broadly validated. In addition, we found that genetic alterations in FGFR, IDH, PIK3CA, BRAF, TP53, and DNA repair pathways are predictable from H&E in multiple tumor types, while many other genetic alterations have rarely been investigated or were only poorly predictable. Finally, we discuss the next steps for the implementation of AI-based surrogate tests in diagnostic workflows. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB The growing success of smart grids (SGs) is driving increased interest in load forecasting (LF) as accurate predictions of energy demand are crucial for ensuring the reliability, stability, and efficiency of SGs. LF techniques aid SGs in making decisions related to power operation and planning upgrades, and can help provide efficient and reliable power services at fair prices. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have also played a significant role in improving the precision of demand forecasting. It is important to evaluate different LF techniques to identify the most accurate and appropriate one for use in SGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, including traditional techniques, clustering-based techniques, AI-based techniques, and time series-based techniques, and provides an analysis of their performance and results. The aim of this paper is to determine which LF technique is most suitable for specific applications in SGs. The findings indicate that AI-based LF techniques, using ML and neural network (NN) models, have shown the best forecast performance compared to other methods, achieving higher overall root mean squared (RMS) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values.

AB This article presents a mapping review of the literature concerning the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. The goal of this review is to summarise current debates and identify open questions for future research. Five literature databases were searched to support the following research question: how can the primary ethical risks presented by AI-health be categorised, and what issues must policymakers, regulators and developers consider in order to be 'ethically mindful? A series of screening stages were carried out-for example, removing articles that focused on digital health in general (e.g. data sharing, data access, data privacy, surveillance/nudging, consent, ownership of health data, evidence of efficacy)-yielding a total of 156 papers that were included in the review.
   We find that ethical issues can be (a) epistemic, related to misguided, inconclusive or inscrutable evidence; (b) normative, related to unfair outcomes and transformative effectives; or (c) related to traceability. We further find that these ethical issues arise at six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and societal or sectoral. Finally, we outline a number of considerations for policymakers and regulators, mapping these to existing literature, and categorising each as epistemic, normative or traceability-related and at the relevant level of abstraction. Our goal is to inform policymakers, regulators and developers of what they must consider if they are to enable health and care systems to capitalise on the dual advantage of ethical AI; maximising the opportunities to cut costs, improve care, and improve the efficiency of health and care systems, whilst proactively avoiding the potential harms. We argue that if action is not swiftly taken in this regard, a new 'AI winter' could occur due to chilling effects related to a loss of public trust in the benefits of AI for health care.

AB The increased water scarcity, depletion of freshwater resources, and rising environmental awareness are stressing for the development of sustainable wastewater treatment processes. Microalgae-based wastewater treatment has resulted in a paradigm shift in our approach toward nutrient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater. Wastewater treatment and the generation of biofuels and bioproducts from microalgae can be coupled to promote the circular economy synergistically. A microalgal biorefinery transforms microalgal biomass into biofuels, bioactive chemicals, and biomaterials. The large-scale cultivation of microalgae is essential for the commercialization and indus-trialization of microalgae biorefinery. However, the inherent complexity of microalgal cultivation parameters regard-ing physiological and illumination parameters renders it challenging to facilitate a smooth and cost-effective operation. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning algorithms (MLA) offer innovative strategies for assessing, predicting, and regulating uncertainties in algal wastewater treatment and biorefinery. The current study presents a critical review of the most promising AI/MLAs that demonstrate a potential to be applied in microalgal technologies. The most commonly used MLAs include artificial neural networks, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, deci-sion tree, and random forest algorithms. Recent developments in AI have made it possible to combine cutting-edge techniques from AI research fields with microalgae for accurate analysis of large datasets. MLAs have been extensively studied for their potential in microalgae detection and classification. However, the ML application in microalgal indus-tries, such as optimizing microalgae cultivation for increased biomass productivity, is still in its infancy. Incorporating smart AI/ML-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) based technologies can help the microalgal industries to operate effectively with minimum resources. Future research directions are also highlighted, and some of the challenges and perspectives of AI/ML are outlined. As the world is entering the digitalized industrial era, this review provides an in-sightful discussion about intelligent microalgal wastewater treatment and biorefinery for researchers in the field of microalgae.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models that can identify safe and dangerous zones of dissection, and anatomical landmarks during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Summary Background Data: Many adverse events during surgery occur due to errors in visual perception and judgment leading to misinterpretation of anatomy. Deep learning, a subfield of AI, can potentially be used to provide real-time guidance intraoperatively. Methods: Deep learning models were developed and trained to identify safe (Go) and dangerous (No-Go) zones of dissection, liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle during LC. Annotations were performed by 4 high-volume surgeons. AI predictions were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation against annotations by expert surgeons. Primary outcomes were intersection- over-union (IOU) and F1 score (validated spatial correlation indices), and secondary outcomes were pixel-wise accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, +/- standard deviation. Results: AI models were trained on 2627 random frames from 290 LC videos, procured from 37 countries, 136 institutions, and 153 surgeons. Mean IOU, F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the AI to identify Go zones were 0.53 (+/- 0.24), 0.70 (+/- 0.28), 0.94 (+/- 0.05), 0.69 (+/- 0.20). and 0.94 (+/- 0.03), respectively. For No-Go zones, these metrics were 0.71 (+/- 0.29), 0.83 (+/- 0.31), 0.95 (+/- 0.06), 0.80 (+/- 0.21), and 0.98 (+/- 0.05), respectively. Mean IOU for identification of the liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle were: 0.86 (+/- 0.12), 0.72 (+/- 0.19), and 0.65 (+/- 0.22), respectively. Conclusions: AI can be used to identify anatomy within the surgical field. This technology may eventually be used to provide real-time guidance and minimize the risk of adverse events.

AB Purpose Many supply chains have faced disruption during Covid-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one mechanism that can be used to improve supply chain resilience by developing business continuity capabilities. This study examines how firms employ AI and consider the opportunities for AI to enhance supply chain resilience by developing visibility, risk, sourcing and distribution capabilities. Design/methodology/approach The authors have gathered rich data by conducting semistructured interviews with 35 experts from the e-commerce supply chain. The authors have adopted a systematic approach of coding using open, axial and selective methods to map and identify the themes that represent the critical elements of AI-enabled supply chain resilience. Findings The results of the study highlight the emergence of five critical areas where AI can contribute to enhanced supply chain resilience; (1) transparency, (2) ensuring last-mile delivery, (3) offering personalized solutions to both upstream and downstream supply chain stakeholders, (4) minimizing the impact of disruption and (5) facilitating an agile procurement strategy. Research limitations/implications The study offers interesting implications for bridging the theory-practice gap by drawing on contemporary empirical data to demonstrate how enhancing dynamic capabilities via AI technologies further strengthens supply chain resilience. The study also offers suggestions for utilizing the findings and proposes a framework to strengthen supply chain resilience through AI. Originality/value The study presents the dynamic capabilities for supply chain resilience through the employment of AI. AI can contribute to readying supply chains to reduce their risk of disruption through enhanced resilience.

AB Purpose In 2018, an artificial intelligence (AI) interview platform was introduced and adopted by companies in Korea. This study aims to explore the perspectives of applicants who have experienced an AI-based interview through this platform and examines the opinions of companies, a platform developer and academia. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a phenomenological approach. The participants, who had recent experience of AI video interviews, were recruited offline and online. Eighteen job applicants in their 20s, two companies that have adopted this interview platform, a software developer who created the platform and three professors participated in the study. To collect data, focus group interviews and in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings As a result, all of them believed that an AI-based interview was more efficient than a traditional one in terms of cost and time savings and is likely to be adopted by more companies in the future. They pointed to the possibility of data bias requiring an improvement in AI accountability. Applicants perceived an AI-based interview to be better than traditional evaluation procedures in procedural fairness, objectivity and consistency of algorithms. However, some applicants were dissatisfied about being assessed by AI. Digital divide and automated inequality were recurring themes in this study. Originality/value The study is important, as it addresses the real application of AI in detail, and a case study of smart hiring tools would be valuable in finding the practical and theoretical implications of such hiring in the fields of employment and AI.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the "how"), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the "ideas"), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the "what"), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the "so what"). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a 'friend' yet a 'foe', (Paradox #2) Generative AI is 'capable' yet 'dependent', (Paradox #3) Generative AI is 'accessible' yet 'restrictive', and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even 'popular' when 'banned' (i.e., the "what"). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarok that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the "so what").

AB Ever since the first introduction of Artificial Intelligence into the field of hydrology, it has further generated immense interest in researching aspects for further improvements to hydrology. This can be seen in the rising number of related works published. This culminated further with the combination of pioneering optimization techniques. Who would have thought that the birds and the bees can offer advances in the mathematical sciences and so have the ants too? The ingenuity of humans is spelled out in the algorithms that mimic many natural activities, like pack hunting by the wolves! This review paper serves to broadcast more of the intriguing interest in newfound procedures in optimal forecasting. Reservoirs are the main and most efficient water storage facilities for managing uneven water distribution. However, due to the major global climate changes which affect rainfall trend and weather, it has been a necessity to find an alternative solution for effective conventional water balance. A multifunctional reservoir operation appears to require the operator to make wise decisions to achieve an optimal reservoir operation. One of the most important aspects of all this is the forecasting of streamflows. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be the best alternative solution; as in the past three decades, there has been a drastic increase in building and developing AI models for forecasting and modelling unstable patterns in various hydrological fields. Nevertheless, AI models are also required to be optimized in tandem to achieve the best result, leading thus to the desirous forming of hybrid models between a standalone AI model and optimization techniques. This comprehensive study categorizes machine learning into three main categories, together with the optimization techniques, and will next explore the various AI model used for different hydrology fields along with the most common optimization techniques. Summarization of findings under every section is provided. Some advantages and disadvantages found through literature reviews are summarized for ease of reference. Finally, future recommendations and overall conclusions drawn from the results of researchers are included. This current review focuses on papers from high-impact factor publications based on 10 years starting from (2009 to 2020). (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TI Explainable artificial intelligence for mental health through
   transparency and interpretability for understandability
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Review
ID DIAGNOSIS; FINGERPRINTS
AB The literature on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) in mental health and psychiatry lacks consensus on what "explainability" means. In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term "explainability" in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to "ground" in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other-as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment.

AB Despite the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI), the potential of AI in customer relationship manage-ment (CRM) remains underexplored in academia. A between-subjects experiment examined the effects of the type of relationship (virtual assistantship versus virtual friendship) consumers build with AI-enabled chatbots on brand personality perception, parasocial interaction (PSI), and CRM. The main effects of the relationship type on brand personality perception appeared for competent brand personality, but not for sincere brand personality. The consumer-chatbot relationship type had effects on CRM-related outcomes (behavioral intention, satisfaction, and trust) through competent brand personality. Consumers who interacted with a friend chatbot experienced stronger PSI with the chatbot, and the relationship type had an influence on brand personality perception through PSI. This mediating effect of PSI was observed for both brand personalities -competence and sincerity. The moderating role of ideological views (technopians versus luddites) in explaining the effect of the relationship type on brand personality perception was detected for sincere brand personality. AI designers and marketers need to develop AI user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) along with marketing strategies that not only can appeal to technopians ready to adopt innovative AI customer representatives but also can ultimately help alle-viate luddites? AI anxiety in the emerging ?feeling economy? envisioned by Rust and Huang.

AB The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has prompted the development of AI-based intelligent products. Accordingly, various technology acceptance theories have been used to explain acceptance of these products. This comparative study determines which models best explain consumer acceptance of AI-based intelligent products and which factors have the greatest impact in terms of purchase intention. We assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) using data collected from a survey sample of 378 respondents, modeling user acceptance in terms of behavioral intention to use AI-based intelligent products. In addition, we employed decomposition analysis to compare each factor included in these models in terms of influence on purchase intention. We found that the VAM performed best in modeling user acceptance. Among the various factors, enjoyment was found to influence user purchase intention the most, followed by subjective norms. The findings of this study confirm that acceptance of highly innovative products with minimal practical value, such as AI-based intelligent products, is more influenced by interest in technology than in utilitarian aspects.

DT Article
AB There has been a surge of interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based medical devices. However, it is poorly understood how and which AI/ML-based medical devices have been approved in the USA and Europe. We searched governmental and non-governmental databases to identify 222 devices approved in the USA and 240 devices in Europe. The number of approved AI/ML-based devices has increased substantially since 2015, with many being approved for use in radiology. However, few were qualified as high-risk devices. Of the 124 AI/ML-based devices commonly approved in the USA and Europe, 80 were first approved in Europe. One possible reason for approval in Europe before the USA might be the potentially relatively less rigorous evaluation of medical devices in Europe. The substantial number of approved devices highlight the need to ensure rigorous regulation of these devices. Currently, there is no specific regulatory pathway for AI/ML-based medical devices in the USA or Europe. We recommend more transparency on how devices are regulated and approved to enable and improve public trust, efficacy, safety, and quality of AI/ML-based medical devices. A comprehensive, publicly accessible database with device details for Conformite Europeene (CE)-marked medical devices in Europe and US Food and Drug Administration approved devices is needed.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) are a key component of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications for creating new content including text, imagery, audio, code, and videos in response to textual instructions. Without human oversight, guidance and responsible design and operation, such generative AI applications will remain a party trick with substantial potential for creating and spreading misinformation or harmful and inaccurate content at unprecedented scale. However, if positioned and developed responsibly as companions to humans augmenting but not replacing their role in decision making, knowledge retrieval and other cognitive processes, they could evolve into highly efficient, trustworthy, assistive tools for information management. This perspective describes how such tools could transform data management workflows in healthcare and medicine, explains how the underlying technology works, provides an assessment of risks and limitations, and proposes an ethical, technical, and cultural framework for responsible design, development, and deployment. It seeks to incentivise users, developers, providers, and regulators of generative AI that utilises LLMs to collectively prepare for the transformational role this technology could play in evidence-based sectors.

AB The emerging sixth generation (6G) is the integration of heterogeneous wireless networks, which can seamlessly support anywhere and anytime networking. But high quality of trust should be offered by 6G to meet mobile user expectations. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered as one of the most important components in 6G. AI-based trust management is a promising paradigm to provide trusted and reliable services. In this article, a generative-adversarial-learning-enabled trust management method is presented for 6G wireless networks. Some typical AI-based trust management schemes are first reviewed, and then a potential heterogeneous and intelligent 6G architecture is introduced. Next, the integration of Al and trust management is developed to optimize intelligence and security. Finally, the presented AI-based trust management method is applied to secure clustering to achieve reliable and real-time communications. Simulation results have demonstrated its excellent performance in guaranteeing network security and service quality.

AB The data-centric revolution generally celebrates the proliferation of business analytics and AI in exploiting firm's potential and success. However, there is a lack of research on how the unintended consequences of AI integrated business analytics (AI-BA) influence a firm's overall competitive advantage. In this backdrop, this study aims to identify how factors, such as AI-BA opacity, suboptimal business decisions and perceived risk are responsible for a firm's operational inefficiency and competitive disadvantage. Drawing on the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and contingency theory, the proposed research model captures the components and effects of an AI-BA opacity on a firm's risk environment and negative performance. The data were gathered from 355 operational, mid-level and senior managers from various service sectors across all different size organisations in India. The results indicated that lack of governance, poor data quality, and inefficient training of key employees led to an AI-BA opacity. It then triggers suboptimal business decisions and higher perceived risk resulting in operational inefficiency. The findings show that operational inefficiency significantly contributes to negative sales growth and employees' dissatisfaction, which result in a competitive disadvantage for a firm. The findings also highlight the significant moderating effect of contingency plan in the nomological chain.

AB PurposeThis paper aims to examine how consumers' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots influence individuals' cognitive and emotional states and their subsequent behavioural intentions vis-a-vis online travel agencies (OTAs). Design/methodology/approachThe survey sample comprised 566 customers who had experienced the use of travel AI chatbots in China using a combination of online and offline questionnaires. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results revealed that interaction and information quality, as AI chatbot stimuli, significantly increase potential tourists' trust and purchase intention. Perceived usefulness plays a mediating role in the relationship among interactivity, information quality, customer trust and purchase intention. Furthermore, the findings indicated that customers with high product familiarity exhibited greater trust in products demonstrating a high level of perceived usefulness. Originality/valueBy integrating cognitive consistency theory, this study theoretically validates the applicability of the stimulus-organism-response framework on AI chatbots and provides academics with useful insights regarding the influence mechanisms of human-computer interaction and information quality on customer response within OTA settings.

   IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly integrated into scientific discovery to augment and accelerate research, helping scientists to generate hypotheses, design experiments, collect and interpret large datasets, and gain insights that might not have been possible using traditional scientific methods alone. Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI toolsneed a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.

AB Radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) may increase the differentiation of benign from malignant kidney lesions, differentiation of angiomyolipoma (AML) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC), differentiation of oncocytoma from RCC, differentiation of different subtypes of RCC, to predict Fuhrman grade, to predict gene mutation through molecular biomarkers and to predict treatment response in metastatic RCC undergoing immunotherapy. Neural networks analyze imaging data. Statistical, geometrical, textural features derived are giving quantitative data of contour, internal heterogeneity and gray zone features of lesions. A comprehensive literature review was performed, until July 2022. Studies investigating the diagnostic value of radiomics in differentiation of renal lesions, grade prediction, gene alterations, molecular biomarkers and ongoing clinical trials have been analyzed. The application of AI and radiomics could lead to improved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy in detecting and differentiating between renal lesions. Standardization of scanner protocols will improve preoperative differentiation between benign, low-risk cancers and clinically significant renal cancers and holds the premises to enhance the diagnostic ability of imaging tools to characterize renal lesions.

AB Clinical routine in hepatology involves the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of meta-bolic, infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Clinicians integrate qualitative and quanti-tative information from multiple data sources to make a diagnosis, prognosticate the disease course, and recommend a treatment. In the last 5 years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning, have made it possible to extract clinically relevant information from complex and diverse clinical datasets. In particular, histopathology and radiology image data contain diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information which AI can extract. Ultimately, such AI systems could be implemented in clinical routine as decision support tools. However, in the context of hepatology, this requires further large-scale clinical validation and regulatory approval. Herein, we summarise the state of the art in AI in hepatology with a particular focus on histopathology and radiology data. We present a roadmap for the further development of novel biomarkers in hep-atology and outline critical obstacles which need to be overcome.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Artificial intelligence (AI) may detect colorectal polyps that have been missed due to perceptual pitfalls. By reducing such miss rate, AI may increase the detection of colorectal neoplasia leading to a higher degree of colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. METHODS: Patients undergoing CRC screening or surveillance were enrolled in 8 centers (Italy, UK, US), and randomized (1:1) to undergo 2 same-day, back-to-back colonoscopies with or without AI (deep learning computer aided diagnosis endoscopy) in 2 different arms, namely AI followed by colonoscopy without AI or vice-versa. Adenoma miss rate (AMR) was calculated as the number of histologically verified lesions detected at second colonoscopy divided by the total number of lesions detected at first and second colonoscopy. Mean number of lesions detected in the second colonoscopy and proportion of false negative subjects (no lesion at first colonoscopy and at least 1 at second) were calculated. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted by endoscopist, age, sex, and indication for colonoscopy. Adverse events were also measured. RESULTS: A total of 230 subjects (116 AI first, 114 standard colonoscopy first) were included in the study analysis. AMR was 15.5% (38 of 246) and 32.4% (80 of 247) in the arm with AI and non-AI colonoscopy first, respectively (adjusted OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.62). In detail, AMR was lower for AI first for the <= 5 mm (15.9% vs 35.8%; OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.55) and nonpolypoid lesions (16.8% vs 45.8%; OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.43), and it was lower both in the proximal (18.3% vs 32.5%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.78) and distal colon (10.8% vs 32.1%; OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.57). Mean number of adenomas at second colonoscopy was lower in the AI-first group as compared with non-AI colonoscopy first (0.33 +/- 0.63 vs 0.70 +/- 0.97, P < .001). False negative rates were 6.8% (3 of 44 patients) and 29.6% (13 of 44) in the AI and non-AI first arms, respectively (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05-0.67). No difference in the rate of adverse events was found between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: AI resulted in an approximately 2-fold reduction in miss rate of colorectal neoplasia, supporting AI-benefit in reducing perceptual errors for small and subtle lesions at standard colonoscopy.

AB As our dependence on intelligent machines continues to grow, so does the demand for more transparent and interpretable models. In addition, the ability to explain the model generally is now the gold standard for building trust and deployment of artificial intelligence systems in critical domains. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to provide a suite of machine learning techniques that enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and produce more explainable models. Selecting an appropriate approach for building an XAI-enabled application requires a clear understanding of the core ideas within XAI and the associated programming frameworks. We survey state-of-the-art programming techniques for XAI and present the different phases of XAI in a typical machine learning development process. We classify the various XAI approaches and, using this taxonomy, discuss the key differences among the existing XAI techniques. Furthermore, concrete examples are used to describe these techniques that are mapped to programming frameworks and software toolkits. It is the intention that this survey will help stakeholders in selecting the appropriate approaches, programming frameworks, and software toolkits by comparing them through the lens of the presented taxonomy.

TI ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MANAGEMENT: THE AUTOMATION-AUGMENTATION
   PARADOX
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MACHINE; PERFORMANCE; PERSPECTIVE; COMPLEXITY;
   HUMANS; TREES; POWER; FIRM
AB Taking three recent business books on artificial intelligence (AI) as a starting point, we explore the automation and augmentation concepts in the management domain. Whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. Overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of AI in organizations. We also argue that a substantial change is required in how AI research is currently conducted in order to develop meaningful theory and to provide practice with sound advice.

TI Explainable artificial intelligence model to predict acute critical
   illness from electronic health records
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS DEFINITIONS; SEPSIS; EXPLANATIONS; NETWORKS
AB Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it. Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Here, the authors develop an explainable artificial intelligence early warning score system for its early detection.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) results in a massive amount of streaming data, often referred to as "big data," which brings new opportunities to monitor agricultural and food processes. Besides sensors, big data from social media is also becoming important for the food industry. In this review, we present an overview of IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI), and their disruptive role in shaping the future of agri-food systems. Following an introduction to the fields of IoT, big data, and AI, we discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in agriculture (including greenhouse monitoring, intelligent farm machines, and drone-based crop imaging), supply chain modernization, social media (for open innovation and sentiment analysis) in food industry, food quality assessment (using spectral methods and sensor fusion), and finally, food safety (using gene sequencing and blockchain-based digital traceability). A special emphasis is laid on the commercial status of applications and translational research outcomes.

AB Purpose of Review With the unprecedented advancement of data aggregation and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform the practice of medicine. The field of orthopedics, in particular, is uniquely suited to harness the power of big data, and in doing so provide critical insight into elevating the many facets of care provided by orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the recent and novel literature regarding ML in the field of orthopedics and to address its potential impact on the future of musculoskeletal care. Recent Findings Recent literature demonstrates that the incorporation of ML into orthopedics has the potential to elevate patient care through alternative patient-specific payment models, rapidly analyze imaging modalities, and remotely monitor patients. Just as the business of medicine was once considered outside the domain of the orthopedic surgeon, we report evidence that demonstrates these emerging applications of AI warrant ownership, leverage, and application by the orthopedic surgeon to better serve their patients and deliver optimal, value-based care.

AB A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication channel between a brain and an external device. With recent advances in neurotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), the brain signals in BCI communication have been advanced from sensation and perception to higher-level cognition activities. While the field of BCI has grown rapidly in the past decades, the core technologies and innovative ideas behind seemingly unrelated BCI systems have never been summarized from an evolutionary point of view. Here, we review various BCI paradigms and present an evolutionary model of generalized BCI technology which comprises three stages: interface, interaction, and intelligence (I3). We also highlight challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives in the development of new BCI technology.

AB Artificial Intelligence is no more the talk of the fiction read in novels or seen in movies. It has been making inroads slowly and gradually in medical education and clinical management of patients apart from all other walks of life. Recently, chatbots particularly ChatGPT, were developed and trained, using a huge amount of textual data from the internet. This has made a significant impact on our approach in medical science. Though there are benefits of this new technology, a lot of caution is required for its use.

AB Purpose of Review Artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds both great promise to transform mental healthcare and potential pitfalls. This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology. Recent Findings We reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI's potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual's unique characteristics. However, caution is necessary in order to avoid over-interpreting preliminary results, and more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a prominent technique for medical diagnosis and represents an essential role in detecting brain tumors. Although AI-based models are widely used in brain lesion segmentation (BLS), understanding their effectiveness is challenging due to their complexity and diversity. Several reviews on brain tumor segmentation are available, but none of them describe a link between the threats due to risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI and its architectures. In our review, we focused on linking RoB and different AI-based architectural Cluster in popular DL framework. Further, due to variance in these designs and input data types in medical imaging, it is necessary to present a narrative review considering all facets of BLS.Approach: The proposed study uses a PRISMA strategy based on 75 relevant studies found by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Based on the architectural evolution, DL studies were subsequently categorized into four classes: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL) based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. These studies were then analyzed considering 32 AI attributes, with clusters including AI architecture, imaging modalities, hyper-parameters, performance evaluation metrics, and clinical evaluation. Then, after these studies were scored for all attributes, a composite score was computed, normalized, and ranked. Thereafter, a bias cutoff (AP(ai)Bias 1.0, AtheroPoint, Roseville, CA, USA) was established to detect low-, moderate-and high-bias studies.Conclusion: The four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. This study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.

AB Due to various challenging issues such as, computational complexity and more delay in cloud computing, edge computing has overtaken the conventional process by efficiently and fairly allocating the resources i.e., power and battery lifetime in Internet of things (IoT)-based industrial applications. In the meantime, intelligent and accurate resource management by artificial intelligence (AI) has become the center of attention especially in industrial applications. With the coordination of AI at the edge will remarkably enhance the range and computational speed of IoT-based devices in industries. But the challenging issue in these power hungry, short battery lifetime, and delay-intolerant portable devices is inappropriate and inefficient classical trends of fair resource allotment. Also, it is interpreted through extensive industrial datasets that dynamic wireless channel could not be supported by the typical power saving and battery lifetime techniques, for example, predictive transmission power control (TPC) and baseline. Thus, this paper proposes 1) a forward central dynamic and available approach (FCDAA) by adapting the running time of sensing and transmission processes in IoT-based portable devices; 2) a system-level battery model by evaluating the energy dissipation in IoT devices; and 3) a data reliability model for edge AI-based IoT devices over hybrid TPC and duty-cycle network. Two important cases, for instance, static (i. e., product processing) and dynamic (i. e., vibration and fault diagnosis) are introduced for proper monitoring of industrial platform. Experimental testbed reveals that the proposed FCDAA enhances energy efficiency and battery lifetime at acceptable reliability (similar to 0.95) by appropriately tuning duty cycle and TPC unlike conventional methods.

AB Immunotherapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors has become a standard treatment strategy for many types of solid tumors. However, the majority of patients with cancer will not respond, and predicting response to this therapy is still a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can extract meaningful information from complex data, such as image data. In clinical routine, radiology or histopathology images are ubiquitously available. AI has been used to predict the response to immunotherapy from radiology or histopathology images, either directly or indirectly via surrogate markers. While none of these methods are currently used in clinical routine, academic and commercial developments are pointing toward potential clinical adoption in the near future. Here, we summarize the state of the art in AI-based image biomarkers for immunotherapy response based on radiology and histopathology images. We point out limitations, caveats, and pitfalls, including biases, generalizability, and explainability, which are relevant for researchers and health care providers alike, and outline key clinical use cases of this new class of predictive biomarkers.

AB Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research-quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ` big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement-exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versaresearchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology up to and including today's "omics". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.

AB Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming more prominent in the tourism industry. Nowadays, consumers are faced with multiple options involving both human and robot interactions. A series of experimental studies were implemented. Four experiments demonstrated that consumers had a more positive attitude toward robot-staffed (vs. human-staffed) hotels when COVID-19 was salient. The results were different from previous studies, which were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the moderating role of perceived threat in consumers' preference for robot-staffed hotels was significant, the respondents' preference was attributed to the global health crisis. This research provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications by improving the understanding of technology acceptance during a health crisis.

AB Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals(1-3), but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients(1,4-6). To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician's selected treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom clinicians' actual doses matched the AI decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient outcomes.

AB A decade of unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated the potential for many fields-including medicine-to benefit from the insights that AI techniques can extract from data. Here we survey recent progress in the development of modern computer vision techniques-powered by deep learning-for medical applications, focusing on medical imaging, medical video, and clinical deployment. We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare. Next, we discuss several example medical imaging applications that stand to benefit-including cardiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology-and propose new avenues for continued work. We then expand into general medical video, highlighting ways in which clinical workflows can integrate computer vision to enhance care. Finally, we discuss the challenges and hurdles required for real-world clinical deployment of these technologies.

TI Automation Bias in Mammography: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence
   BI-RADS Suggestions on Reader Performance
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY; TRUST; AI
AB Background: Automation bias (the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems) is a known source of error in human-machine interactions, but its implications regarding artificial intelligence (AI)-aided mammography reading are unknown. Purpose: To determine how automation bias can affect inexperienced, moderately experienced, and very experienced radiologists when reading mammograms with the aid of an artificial intelligence (AI) system.Materials and Methods: In this prospective experiment, 27 radiologists read 50 mammograms and provided their Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment assisted by a purported AI system. Mammograms were obtained between January 2017 and December 2019 and were presented in two randomized sets. The first was a training set of 10 mammograms, with the correct BI-RADS category suggested by the AI system. The second was a set of 40 mammograms in which an incorrect BI-RADS category was suggested for 12 mammograms. Reader performance, degree of bias in BI-RADS scoring, perceived accuracy of the AI system, and reader confidence in their own BI-RADS ratings were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by the Dunn post hoc test.Results: The percentage of correctly rated mammograms by inexperienced (mean, 79.7% & PLUSMN; 11.7 [SD] vs 19.8% & PLUSMN; 14.0; P < .001; r = 0.93), moderately experienced (mean, 81.3% & PLUSMN; 10.1 vs 24.8% & PLUSMN; 11.6; P < .001; r = 0.96), and very experienced (mean, 82.3% & PLUSMN; 4.2 vs 45.5% & PLUSMN; 9.1; P = .003; r = 0.97) radiologists was significantly impacted by the correctness of the AI prediction of BI-RADS category. Inexperienced radiologists were significantly more likely to follow the suggestions of the purported AI when it incorrectly suggested a higher BI-RADS category than the actual ground truth compared with both moderately (mean degree of bias, 4.0 & PLUSMN; 1.8 vs 2.4 & PLUSMN; 1.5; P = .044; r = 0.46) and very (mean degree of bias, 4.0 & PLUSMN; 1.8 vs 1.2 & PLUSMN; 0.8; P = .009; r = 0.65) experienced readers.Conclusion: The results show that inexperienced, moderately experienced, and very experienced radiologists reading mammograms are prone to automation bias when being supported by an AI-based system. This and other effects of human and machine interaction must be considered to ensure safe deployment and accurate diagnostic performance when combining human readers and AI.

AB BACKGROUND Clinical reads of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), especially by less experienced readers, may result in overestimation of coronary artery disease stenosis severity compared with expert interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions applied to coronary CTA may overcome these limitations. OBJECTIVES This study compared the performance for detection and grading of coronary stenoses using artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary computed tomography (AI-QCT) angiography analyses to core lab-interpreted coronary CTA, core lab quantitative coronary angiography (QCA), and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). METHODS Coronary CTA, FFR, and QCA data from 303 stable patients (64 +/- 10 years of age, 71% male) from the CREDENCE (Computed TomogRaphic Evaluation of Atherosclerotic DEtermiNants of Myocardial IsChEmia) trial were retrospectively analyzed using an Food and Drug Administration-cleared cloud-based software that performs AI-enabled coronary segmentation, lumen and vessel wall determination, plaque quantification and characterization, and stenosis determination. RESULTS Disease prevalence was high, with 32.0%, 35.0%, 21.0%, and 13.0% demonstrating >= 50% stenosis in 0, 1, 2, and 3 coronary vessel territories, respectively. Average AI-QCT analysis time was 10.3 +/- 2.7 minutes. AI-QCT evaluation demonstrated per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 94%, 68%, 81%, 90%, and 84%, respectively, for >= 50% stenosis, and of 94%, 82%, 69%, 97%, and 86%, respectively, for detection of >= 70% stenosis. There was high correlation between stenosis detected on AI-QCT evaluation vs QCA on a per-vessel and per-patient basis (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.73 and 0.73, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). False positive AI-QCT findings were noted in in 62 of 848 (7.3%) vessels (stenosis of >= 70% by AI-QCT and QCA of < 70%); however, 41 (66.1%) of these had an FFR of < 0.8. CONCLUSIONS A novel AI-based evaluation of coronary CTA enables rapid and accurate identification and exclusion of high-grade stenosis and with close agreement to blinded, core lab-interpreted quantitative coronary angiography.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are predicted to infiltrate most industries within the next decade, creating a personal, industrial, and social shift towards the new technology. As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies.

AB Background and objective: During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic.
   Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
   Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead.
   Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of the industrial and digital (information) revolutions has, undoubtedly, been substantial on practically all aspects of our society, life, firms and employment. Will the forthcoming AI revolution produce similar, far-reaching effects? By examining analogous inventions of the industrial, digital and Al revolutions, this article claims that the latter is on target and that it would bring extensive changes that will also affect all aspects of our society and life. In addition, its impact on firms and employment will be considerable, resulting in richly interconnected organizations with decision making based on the analysis and exploitation of "big" data and intensified, global competition among firms. People will be capable of buying goods and obtaining services from anywhere in the world using the Internet, and exploiting the unlimited, additional benefits that will open through the widespread usage of AI inventions. The paper concludes that significant competitive advantages will continue to accrue to those utilizing the Internet widely and willing to take entrepreneurial risks in order to turn innovative products/services into worldwide commercial success stories. The greatest challenge facing societies and firms would be utilizing the benefits of availing AI technologies, providing vast opportunities for both new products/services and immense productivity improvements while avoiding the dangers and disadvantages in terms of increased unemployment and greater wealth inequalities.

AB Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.

AB Objective To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for improving clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared to human-generated suggestions. Methods We supplied summaries of CDS logic to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a large language model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy. Results Five clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy. Conclusion AI-generated suggestions could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced learning health system.

AB Deployment of robots has become prevalent in the service sector. The advanced digital technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), and the current COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the wide application of service robots to provide quality customer experience with limited in-person service encounters. Many of today's service robots perform not only complex services, but they are anthropomorphic with physical and psychological states like humans. This study investigates how the varying degree of anthropomorphism in robots affect customers' perceived service quality. A research model with associated hypotheses was developed based on affect-as-information theory. The study collected data from 455 randomly selected customers who were served by either a mechanical robot (automatic on-demand coffee maker) or an anthropomorphic robot (travel information assistant). The results of the study showed that anthropomorphism has a significant positive impact on intimacy between robots and humans, intimacy has significant positive impact on customers' perceived service quality, and intimacy has a mediating role on the relationship between anthropomorphism and service quality.

AB High-impact weather events, such as severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes, cause significant disruptions to infrastructure, property loss, and even fatalities. High-impact events can also positively impact society, such as the impact on savings through renewable energy. Prediction of these events has improved substantially with greater observational capabilities, increased computing power, and better model physics, but there is still significant room for improvement. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science technologies, specifically machine learning and data mining, bridge the gap between numerical model prediction and real-time guidance by improving accuracy. AI techniques also extract otherwise unavailable information from forecast models by fusing model output with observations to provide additional decision support for forecasters and users. In this work, we demonstrate that applying AI techniques along with a physical understanding of the environment can significantly improve the prediction skill for multiple types of high-impact weather. The AI approach is also a contribution to the growing field of computational sustainability. The authors specifically discuss the prediction of storm duration, severe wind, severe hail, precipitation classification, forecasting for renewable energy, and aviation turbulence. They also discuss how AI techniques can process big data, provide insights into high-impact weather phenomena, and improve our understanding of high-impact weather.

AB Companies have repeatedly launched Artificial Intelligence (AI) products such as intelligent chatbots and robots with female names, voices, and bodies. Previous research posits that people intuitively favor female over male bots, mainly because female bots are judged as warmer and more likely to experience emotions. We present five online studies, including four preregistered, with a total sample of over 3,000 participants that go beyond this longstanding perception of femininity. Because warmth and experience (but not competence) are seen as fundamental qualities to be a full human but are lacking in machines, we argue that people prefer female bots because they are perceived as more human than male bots. Using implicit, subtle, and blatant scales of humanness, our results consistently show that women (Studies 1A and 1B), female bots (Studies 2 and 3), and female chatbots (Study 4) are perceived as more human than their male counterparts when compared with non-human entities (animals and machines). Study 4 investigates explicitly the acceptance of gendered algorithms operated by AI chatbots in a health context. We found that the female chatbot is preferred over the male chatbot because it is perceived as more human and more likely to consider our unique needs. These results highlight the ethical quandary faced by AI designers and policymakers: Women are said to be transformed into objects in AI, but injecting women's humanity into AI objects makes these objects seem more human and acceptable.

ID SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; TUBERCULOSIS; INFORMATION; MORTALITY; NETWORKS
AB Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.

AB Deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods seem to be a part of indispensable factors to achieve human-level or super-human AI systems. On the other hand, both DL and RL have strong connections with our brain functions and with neuroscientific findings. In this review, we summarize talks and discussions in the "Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning"session of the symposium, International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science. In this session, we discussed whether we can achieve comprehensive understanding of human intelligence based on the recent advances of deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Speakers contributed to provide talks about their recent studies that can be key technologies to achieve human-level intelligence. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The discovery and advances of medicines may be considered as the ultimate relevant translational science effort that adds to human invulnerability and happiness. But advancing a fresh medication is a quite convoluted, costly, and protracted operation, normally costing USD similar to 2.6 billion and consuming a mean time span of 12 years. Methods to cut back expenditure and hasten new drug discovery have prompted an arduous and compelling brainstorming exercise in the pharmaceutical industry. The engagement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the deep-learning (DL) component in particular, has been facilitated by the employment of classified big data, in concert with strikingly reinforced computing prowess and cloud storage, across all fields. AI has energized computer-facilitated drug discovery. An unrestricted espousing of machine learning (ML), especially DL, in many scientific specialties, and the technological refinements in computing hardware and software, in concert with various aspects of the problem, sustain this progress. ML algorithms have been extensively engaged for computer-facilitated drug discovery. DL methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) comprising multiple buried processing layers, have of late seen a resurgence due to their capability to power automatic attribute elicitations from the input data, coupled with their ability to obtain nonlinear input-output pertinencies. Such features of DL methods augment classical ML techniques which bank on human-contrived molecular descriptors. A major part of the early reluctance concerning utility of AI in pharmaceutical discovery has begun to melt, thereby advancing medicinal chemistry. AI, along with modern experimental technical knowledge, is anticipated to invigorate the quest for new and improved pharmaceuticals in an expeditious, economical, and increasingly compelling manner. DL-facilitated methods have just initiated kickstarting for some integral issues in drug discovery. Many technological advances, such as "message-passing paradigms", "spatial-symmetry-preserving networks", "hybrid de novo design", and other ingenious ML exemplars, will definitely come to be pervasively widespread and help dissect many of the biggest, and most intriguing inquiries. Open data allocation and model augmentation will exert a decisive hold during the progress of drug discovery employing AI. This review will address the impending utilizations of AI to refine and bolster the drug discovery operation.

AB Through a community-driven competition, the PANDA challenge provides a curated diverse dataset and a catalog of models for prostate cancer pathology, and represents a blueprint for evaluating AI algorithms in digital pathology.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for diagnosing prostate cancer in biopsies. However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge-the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers-to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted kappa, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840-0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835-0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.

AB In the current era, water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems performing at radiologist-like levels in the evaluation of digital mammography (DM) would improve breast cancer screening accuracy and efficiency. We aimed to compare the stand-alone performance of an AI system to that of radiologists in detecting breast cancer in DM.
   Methods: Nine multi-reader, multi-case study datasets previously used for different research purposes in seven countries were collected. Each dataset consisted of DM exams acquired with systems from four different vendors, multiple radiologists' assessments per exam, and ground truth verified by histopathological analysis or follow-up, yielding a total of 2652 exams (653 malignant) and interpretations by 101 radiologists (28 296 independent interpretations). An AI system analyzed these exams yielding a level of suspicion of cancer present between 1 and 10. The detection performance between the radiologists and the AI system was compared using a noninferiority null hypothesis at a margin of 0.05.
   Results: The performance of the AI system was statistically noninferior to that of the average of the 101 radiologists. The AI system had a 0.840 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.820 to 0.860) area under the ROC curve and the average of the radiologists was 0.814 (95% CI = 0.787 to 0.841) (difference 95% CI = -0.003 to 0.055). The AI system had an AUC higher than 61.4% of the radiologists.
   Conclusions: The evaluated AI system achieved a cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist in this retrospective setting. Although promising, the performance and impact of such a system in a screening setting needs further investigation.

AB PurposeAI-based chatbots are revamping employee communication in organizations. This paper examines the adoption of AI-based employee experience chatbots by employees.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed model is developed using behavioral reasoning theory and empirically validated by surveying 1,130 employees and data was analyzed with PLS-SEM.FindingsThis research presents the "reasons for" and "reasons against" for the acceptance of AI-based employee experience chatbots. The "reasons for" are - personalization, interactivity, perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism and the "reasons against" are perceived risk, language barrier and technological anxiety. It is found that "reasons for" have a positive association with attitude and adoption intention and "reasons against" have a negative association. Employees' values for openness to change are positively associated with "reasons for" and do not affect attitude and "reasons against".Originality/valueThis is the first study exploring employees' attitude and adoption intention toward AI-based EEX chatbots using behavioral reasoning theory.

AB Purpose Considering the increasing impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on financial technology (FinTech), the purpose of this paper is to propose a research framework to better understand robo-advisor adoption by a wide range of potential customers. It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings Consumers' attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Originality/value This research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables. It contributes to understanding consumers' perceptions regarding the introduction of AI in FinTech.

AB Multimodal artificial intelligence models could unlock many exciting applications in health and medicine; this Review outlines the most promising uses and the technical pitfalls to avoid.
   The increasing availability of biomedical data from large biobanks, electronic health records, medical imaging, wearable and ambient biosensors, and the lower cost of genome and microbiome sequencing have set the stage for the development of multimodal artificial intelligence solutions that capture the complexity of human health and disease. In this Review, we outline the key applications enabled, along with the technical and analytical challenges. We explore opportunities in personalized medicine, digital clinical trials, remote monitoring and care, pandemic surveillance, digital twin technology and virtual health assistants. Further, we survey the data, modeling and privacy challenges that must be overcome to realize the full potential of multimodal artificial intelligence in health.

We extracted bibliographical data from the Web of Science database and analysed it using the Bibliometrix tool in R software. Based on citation analysis metrics, we revealed the most influential articles, journals, authors and institutions. Using the bibliographic coupling methodology, we identified four underlying research clusters: (1) digital transformation in maritime industry, (2) applications of big data from AIS, (3) energy efficiency and (4) predictive analytics. We analysed these clusters in detail and extracted future research questions. Besides, we present research collaboration networks on the institution and author level.

AB Over the last decade there has been an extensive evolution in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Modern radiation oncology is based on the exploitation of advanced computational methods aiming to personalization and high diagnostic and therapeutic precision. The quantity of the available imaging data and the increased developments of Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), triggered the research on uncovering "hidden" biomarkers and quantitative features from anatomical and functional medical images. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved outstanding performance and broad implementation in image processing tasks. Lately, DNNs have been considered for radiomics and their potentials for explainable AI (XAI) may help classification and prediction in clinical practice. However, most of them are using limited datasets and lack generalized applicability. In this study we review the basics of radiomics feature extraction, DNNs in image analysis, and major interpretability methods that help enable explainable AI. Furthermore, we discuss the crucial requirement of multicenter recruitment of large datasets, increasing the biomarkers variability, so as to establish the potential clinical value of radiomics and the development of robust explainable AI models.

AB Edge intelligence (EI) migrates data and artificial intelligence (AI) to the "edge " of a network, enhancing the high-bandwidth and low-latency of wireless data transmission with the multiplier effect of 5G and AI, greatly improving the edges' processing speed. Through integrating EI and computer vision technology, video surveillance systems in ITS can improve the processing capability of traffic information, which improves traffic efficiency and ensures traffic safety. Accordingly, first, we propose an edge intelligence-based improved-YOLOv4 vehicle detection algorithm, introducing an efficient channel attention (ECA) mechanism and a high-resolution network (HRNet) to enhance vehicle detection ability. Second, an edge intelligence-based improved DeepLabv3+ image segmentation algorithm is proposed, replacing the original backbone network with MobileNetv2 and using the softpool method, thus reducing the network size while improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model has a higher average precision (AP) and can improve vehicle detection accuracy from 82.03% to 86.22%. The mean intersection over union (mIOU) of the image segmentation model improves from 73.32% to 75.63%.

AB The rise of Big, Open and Linked Data (BOLD) enables Big Data Algorithmic Systems (BDAS) which are often based on machine learning, neural networks and other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As such systems are increasingly requested to make decisions that are consequential to individuals, communities and society at large, their failures cannot be tolerated, and they are subject to stringent regulatory and ethical requirements. However, they all rely on data which is not only big, open and linked but varied, dynamic and streamed at high speeds in real-time. Managing such data is challenging. To overcome such challenges and utilize opportunities for BDAS, organizations are increasingly developing advanced data governance capabilities. This paper reviews challenges and approaches to data governance for such systems, and proposes a framework for data governance for trustworthy BDAS. The framework promotes the stewardship of data, processes and algorithms, the controlled opening of data and algorithms to enable external scrutiny, trusted information sharing within and between organizations, risk-based governance, system-level controls, and data control through shared ownership and self-sovereign identities. The framework is based on 13 design principles and is proposed incrementally, for a single organization and multiple networked organizations.

AB Rapid advances in technology have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of Industry 4.0 that was initially introduced in 2011 as a German strategic initiative for revolutionizing the manufacturing sector. Ten years have passed since 2011. In these ten years, numerous new and promising technologies and applications have been developed. The original concept of Industry 4.0, including the conceptual framework, technology framework, and enabling technologies, has experienced tremendous changes. As such, the new generation of Industry 4.0 emerges, which is also called Industry 5.0. Today, we are on the cusp of the Industry 4.0 evolution supported by a new set of enabling technologies. In such evolution of Industry 4.0, future Industry 4.0 requires a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of the next generation of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others. The technologies in the original Industry 4.0 framework, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT, etc., will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, and Quantum Computing. At this present moment, the emergence of a new era of Industry 4.0 can be seen. In this paper, we briefly survey the main emerging enabling technologies in Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.

AB The need of self-powered sensors and self-sustainable micro-/nano-systems is increasing for smart home applications. With the aid of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication and the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, numerous sensors can form an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) system with a cloud computing server to collect, store, process, analyze data, and control the system. In this review, we briefly introduce the major sensor transducing mechanisms and the corresponding representative sensors. Then we emphasize the discussion of triboelectric sensors and their use as various types of human machine interfaces (HMIs). Regarding integrated self-sustainable systems with energy storage function for more general application scenarios, we present the recent advances of integration of triboelectric nanogenerator with supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells. The development of materials and configurations with novel functionalities to improve the system performance are discussed. We present the state-of-the-art works based on the synergy between wearable sensors and AI technology, highlighting the system-level function of analyzing abundant sensory data, recognizing events, and making decisions accordingly. We wrap up the review by providing our perspectives of future development of self-powered sensors and self-sustainable micro-/nano-systems towards improved wearability, multifunctionality, better self-sustainability via multi-domain energy harvesting and storage technology integration, and higher-level intelligence for complex scenarios.

AB The term "artificial intelligence" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which "learns" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute ("explainable AI"). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.

AB In the last few years, the trend in health care of embracing artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed the medical landscape. Medical centres have adopted AI applications to increase the accuracy of disease diag-nosis and mitigate health risks. AI applications have changed rules and policies related to healthcare practice and work ethics. However, building trustworthy and explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare systems is still in its early stages. Specifically, the European Union has stated that AI must be human-centred and trustworthy, whereas in the healthcare sector, low methodological quality and high bias risk have become major concerns. This study endeavours to offer a systematic review of the trustworthiness and explainability of AI applications in healthcare, incorporating the assessment of quality, bias risk, and data fusion to supplement previous studies and provide more accurate and definitive findings. Likewise, 64 recent contributions on the trustworthiness of AI in healthcare from multiple databases (i.e., ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore) were identified using a rigorous literature search method and selection criteria. The considered papers were categorised into a coherent and systematic classification including seven categories: explainable robotics, prediction, decision support, blockchain, transparency, digital health, and review. In this paper, we have presented a systematic and comprehensive analysis of earlier studies and opened the door to potential future studies by discussing in depth the challenges, motivations, and recommendations. In this study a systematic science mapping analysis in order to reorganise and summarise the results of earlier studies to address the issues of trustworthiness and objectivity was also performed. Moreover, this work has provided decisive evidence for the trustworthiness of AI in health care by presenting eight current state-of-the-art critical analyses regarding those more relevant research gaps. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of utilising trustworthy and XAI applications in healthcare, by incorporating data fusion techniques and connecting various important pieces of information from available healthcare datasets and AI algorithms. The analysis of the revised contri-butions revealed crucial implications for academics and practitioners, and then potential methodological aspects to enhance the trustworthiness of AI applications in the medical sector were reviewed. Successively, the theo-retical concept and current use of 17 XAI methods in health care were addressed. Finally, several objectives and guidelines were provided to policymakers to establish electronic health-care systems focused on achieving relevant features such as legitimacy, morality, and robustness. Several types of information fusion in healthcare were focused on in this study, including data, feature, image, decision, multimodal, hybrid, and temporal.

Last decades' research has immensely focussed on river basin water quality (WQ) prediction, risk assessment and pollutant classification techniques to design more potent management policies and advanced early warning system. The next challenge is dealing with water-related data as they are problematic to handle owing to their nonlinearity, nonstationary feature and vague properties due to the unpredictable natural changes, interdependent relationship, human interference and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown remarkable success and superiority to handle such data owing to their higher accuracy to deal with non-linear data, robustness, reliability, cost-effectiveness, problem-solving capability, decision-making capability, efficiency and effectiveness. AI models are the perfect tools for river WQ monitoring, management, sustainability and policymaking. This research reports the state of the art of various AI models implemented for river WQ simulation over the past two decades (2000-2020). Correspondingly, over 200 research articles are reviewed from the Web of Science journals. The survey covers the model structure, input variability, performance metrics, regional generalisation investigation and comprehensive assessments of AI models progress in river water quality research. The increasing contaminants, the lack of funding and the deficiency in data, numerous variables and unique data time series pattern based on the geological area have increased the need for river WQ monitoring and control even more. Hence, this is highly emphasising the involvement of AI models development which can deal with missing data, able to integrate the features of a black-box model and white-box models, benchmarked model and automated early warning system are few of many points need more research. Despite extensive research on WQ simulation using AI models, shortcomings remain according to the current survey, and several possible future research directions are proposed. Overall, this survey provides a new milestone in water resource engineering on the AI model implementation, innovation and transformation in surface WQ modelling with many formidable problems in different blossoming area and objectives to be achieved in the future.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad concept that usually refers to computer programs that can learn from data and perform certain specific tasks. In the recent years, the growth of deep learning, a successful tech-nique for computer vision tasks that does not require explicit programming, coupled with the availability of large imaging databases fostered the development of multiple applications in the medical imaging field, especially for lung nodules and lung cancer, mostly through convolutional neural networks (CNN). Some of the first applications of AI is this field were dedicated to automated detection of lung nodules on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations, with performances now reaching or exceeding those of radiolog-ists. For lung nodule segmentation, CNN-based algorithms applied to CT images show excellent spatial over-lap index with manual segmentation, even for irregular and ground glass nodules. A third application of AI is the classification of lung nodules between malignant and benign, which could limit the number of follow-up CT examinations for less suspicious lesions. Several algorithms have demonstrated excellent capabilities for the prediction of the malignancy risk when a nodule is discovered. These different applications of AI for lung nodules are particularly appealing in the context of lung cancer screening. In the field of lung cancer, AI tools applied to lung imaging have been investigated for distinct aims. First, they could play a role for the non-invasive characterization of tumors, especially for histological subtype and somatic mutation predictions, with a potential therapeutic impact. Additionally, they could help predict the patient prognosis, in combina-tion to clinical data. Despite these encouraging perspectives, clinical implementation of AI tools is only begin-ning because of the lack of generalizability of published studies, of an inner obscure working and because of limited data about the impact of such tools on the radiologists' decision and on the patient outcome. Radiol-ogists must be active participants in the process of evaluating AI tools, as such tools could support their daily work and offer them more time for high added value tasks.(c) 2022 Societe francaise de radiologie.

AB With the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques have been widely used in long-span bridges. However, due to limitations of computational ability and data analysis methods, the knowledge in massive SHM data is not well interpreted. Big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are seen as promising ways to address the data interpretation problem. This paper aims to clarify the scope of BD and AI techniques on what and how regarding bridge SHM. The BD and AI techniques are summarized, and the requirements of bridge SHM for new techniques are generalized. Applications of BD and AI techniques in bridge SHM are reviewed, respectively. BD techniques can be divided into two categories, namely computing techniques and data analysis methods. The computing techniques are employed in SHM to build a BD-oriented SHM framework and to address computing problems, while the data analysis methods are introduced under a pipeline of BD analysis, application scenarios of BD techniques in bridge SHM are proposed in each step of this pipeline. The state of the art of deep learning in SHM is introduced to represent AI applications, which are concerned with processing unstructured data for visual inspection and time series for structural damage detection. Finally, the upper limit, challenges, and future trends are discussed. As a review, the paper offers meaningful perspectives and suggestions for employing BD and AI techniques in the field of bridge SHM. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Communicating with customers through live chat interfaces has become an increasingly popular means to provide real-time customer service in many e-commerce settings. Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot's request for service feedback. Moreover, the results show that social presence mediates the effect of anthropomorphic design cues on user compliance.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.

AB Cancer is an aggressive disease with a low median survival rate. Ironically, the treatment process is long and very costly due to its high recurrence and mortality rates. Accurate early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer are essential to enhance the patient's survival rate. Developments in statistics and computer engineering over the years have encouraged many scientists to apply computational methods such as multivariate statistical analysis to analyze the prognosis of the disease, and the accuracy of such analyses is significantly higher than that of empirical predictions. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning and deep learning, has found popular applications in clinical cancer research in recent years, cancer prediction performance has reached new heights. This article reviews the literature on the application of AI to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and summarizes its advantages. We explore how AI assists cancer diagnosis and prognosis, specifically with regard to its unprecedented accuracy, which is even higher than that of general statistical applications in oncology. We also demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the clinical implementation of AI are discussed. Hence, this article provides a new perspective on how AI technology can help improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and continue improving human health in the future.

TI Complexity of ballooned hepatocyte feature recognition: Defining a
   training atlas for artificial intelligence-based imaging in NAFLD

AB Background & Aims: Histologically assessed hepatocyte ballooning is a key feature discriminating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from steatosis (NAFL). Reliable identification underpins patient inclusion in clinical trials and serves as a key regulatory-approved surrogate endpoint for drug efficacy. High inter/intra-observer variation in ballooning measured using the NASH CRN semi-quantitative score has been reported yet no actionable solutions have been proposed.
   Methods: A focused evaluation of hepatocyte ballooning recognition was conducted. Digitized slides were evaluated by 9 internationally recognized expert liver pathologists on 2 separate occasions: each pathologist independently marked every ballooned hepatocyte and later provided an overall non-NASH NAFL/NASH assessment. Interobserver variation was assessed and a `concordance atlas' of ballooned hepatocytes generated to train second harmonic generation/two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI).
   Results: The Fleiss kappa statistic for overall interobserver agreement for presence/absence of ballooning was 0.197 (95% CI 0.094-0.300), rising to 0.362(0.258-0.465) with a >= 5-cell threshold. However, the intraclass correlation coefficient for consistency was higher (0.718 [0.511-0.900]), indicating `moderate' agreement on ballooning burden. 133 ballooned cellswere identified using a >= 5/9 majority to train AI ballooning detection (AI-pathologist pairwise concordance 19-42%, comparable to inter-pathologist pairwise concordance of between 8-75%). AI quantified change in ballooned cell burden in response to therapy in a separate slide set.
   Conclusions: The substantial divergence in hepatocyte ballooning identified amongst expert hepatopathologists suggests that ballooning is a spectrum, too subjective for its presence or complete absence to be unequivocally determined as a trial endpoint. A concordance atlas may be used to train AI assistive technologies to reproducibly quantify ballooned hepatocytes that standardize assessment of therapeutic efficacy. This atlas serves as a reference standard for ongoing work to refine how ballooning is classified by both pathologists and AI.
   Lay summary: For the first time, we show that, even amongst expert hepatopathologists, there is poor agreement regardingthe number of ballooned hepatocytes seen on the same digitized histology images. This has important implications as the presence of ballooning is needed to establish the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and its unequivocal absence is one of the key requirements to show 'NASH resolution' to support drug efficacy in clinical trials. Artificial intelligence-based approaches may provide a more reliable way to assess the range of injury recorded as "hepatocyte ballooning".

AB When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.

ID INDIVIDUAL PROGNOSIS; APPLICABILITY; EXPLANATION
AB Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford on 10-December-2020 (R73034/RE001). Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-review publications. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019140361 and CRD42019161764.

TI Artificial intelligence for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Chest CT is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for differentiation of COVID-19 findings from other clinical entities. Here we show that a series of deep learning algorithms, trained in a diverse multinational cohort of 1280 patients to localize parietal pleura/lung parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, can achieve up to 90.8% accuracy, with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity, as evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training and validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 10%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify CT scans with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID related pneumonias with high specificity in diverse patient populations.

AB Chemometrics play a critical role in biosensors-based detection, analysis, and diagnosis. Nowadays, as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) have achieved impressive advances. However, novel advanced ML methods, especially deep learning, which is famous for image analysis, facial recognition, and speech recognition, has remained relatively elusive to the biosensor community. Herein, how ML can be beneficial to biosensors is systematically discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of most popular ML algorithms are summarized on the basis of sensing data analysis. Specially, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are emphasized. Diverse ML-assisted electrochemical biosensors, wearable electronics, SERS and other spectra-based biosensors, fluorescence biosensors and colorimetric biosensors are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, biosensor networks and multibiosensor data fusion are introduced. This review will nicely bridge ML with biosensors, and greatly expand chemometrics for detection, analysis, and diagnosis.

AB The global healthcare sector continues to grow rapidly and is reflected as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the fourth industrial revolution (4.0). The majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare and biomedical sectors.

AB Currently, vaccination is the most effective medical measure to improve group immunity and prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19. Since the individual difference of vaccine effectiveness is inevitable, it is necessary to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness of every vaccinated person to ensure the appearance of herd immunity. Here, we developed an artificial intelligent (AI)-assisted colorimetric polydopamine nanoparticle (PDA)-based lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform for the sensitive and accurate quantification of neutralizing antibodies produced from vaccinations. The platform integrates PDA-based LFIA and a smartphone-based reader to test the neutralizing antibodies in serum, where an AI algorithm is also developed to accurately and quantitatively analyze the results. The developed platform achieved a quantitative detection with 160 ng/mL of detection limit and 625-10000 ng/mL of detection range. Moreover, it also successfully detected totally 50 clinical serum samples, revealing a great consistency with the commercial ELISA kit. Comparing with commercial gold nanoparticle-based LFIA, our PDA-based LFIA platform showed more accurate quantification ability for the clinical serum. Therefore, we envision that the AI-assisted PDA-based LFIA platform with sensitive and accurate quantification ability is of great significance for large-scale evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and other point-of care immunoassays.

AB Retinal vasculature provides an opportunity for direct observation of vessel morphology, which is linked to multiple clinical conditions. However, objective and quantitative interpretation of the retinal vasculature relies on precise vessel segmentation, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated great promise in retinal vessel segmentation. The development and evaluation of AI-based models require large numbers of annotated retinal images. However, the public datasets that are usable for this task are scarce. In this paper, we collected a color fundus image vessel segmentation (FIVES) dataset. The FIVES dataset consists of 800 high-resolution multi-disease color fundus photographs with pixelwise manual annotation. The annotation process was standardized through crowdsourcing among medical experts. The quality of each image was also evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retinal vessel segmentation dataset for which we believe this work will be beneficial to the further development of retinal vessel segmentation.

TI Artificial intelligence-enabled rapid diagnosis of patients with

SO NATURE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB For diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is routinely used. However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.
   Artificial intelligence algorithms integrating chest computed tomography scans and clinical information can diagnose COVID-19 with similar accuracy as compared to a senior radiologist.

AB With the prevalence of smart appliances, smart meters, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart grids, artificial intelligence (AI) built on the rich IoT big data enables various energy data analysis applications and brings intelligent and personalized energy services for users. In conventional AI of Things (AIoT) paradigms, a wealth of individual energy data distributed across users' IoT devices needs to be migrated to a central storage (e.g., cloud or edge device) for knowledge extraction, which may impose severe privacy violation and data misuse risks. Federated learning, as an appealing privacy-preserving AI paradigm, enables energy data owners (EDOs) to cooperatively train a shared AI model without revealing the local energy data. Nevertheless, potential security and efficiency concerns still impede the deployment of federated-learning-based AIoT services in smart grids due to the low-quality shared local models, non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions, and unpredictable communication delays. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient federated-learning-enabled AIoT scheme for private energy data sharing in smart grids with edge-cloud collaboration. Specifically, we first introduce an edge-cloud-assisted federated learning framework for communication-efficient and privacy-preserving energy data sharing of users in smart grids. Then, by considering non-IID effects, we design a local data evaluation mechanism in federated learning and formulate two optimization problems for EDOs and energy service providers. Furthermore, due to the lack of knowledge of multidimensional user private information in practical scenarios, a two-layer deep reinforcement-learning-based incentive algorithm is developed to promote EDOs' participation and high-quality model contribution. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively stimulate EDOs to share high-quality local model updates and improve the communication efficiency.

AB The emerging Industry 4.0 technologies that are impacting the global economy also represent an extraordinary opportunity to increase customer value in the service sector. Indeed, the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution differs from previous technologies in three main ways: (1) technological developments overcomes humans' capabilities such that humans or even companies are no longer controlling technology; (2) customers embrace life in new technology-made environments, and (3) the boundaries between human and technology become to be blurred. This document explains these novel insights and defines the key AI-related concepts linked to each of these three distinctive aspects of Technologies 4.0 in services.

ID PREDICTION; MODEL; RISK
AB Background: Microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is a key genetic feature which should be tested in every patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) according to medical guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can detect MSI/dMMR directly in routine pathology slides, but the test performance has not been systematically investigated with predefined test thresholds.
   Method: We trained and validated AI-based MSI/dMMR detectors and evaluated predefined performance metrics using nine patient cohorts of 8343 patients across different countries and ethnicities.
   Results: Classifiers achieved clinical-grade performance, yielding an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of up to 0.96 without using any manual annotations. Subsequently, we show that the AI system can be applied as a ruleout test: by using cohort-specific thresholds, on average 52.73% of tumors in each surgical cohort [total number of MSI/ dMMR = 1020, microsatellite stable (MSS)/ proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) = 7323 patients] could be identified as MSS/pMMR with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. In an additional cohort of N = 1530 (MSI/dMMR = 211, MSS/pMMR = 1319) endoscopy biopsy samples, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.89, and the cohort-specific threshold ruled out 44.12% of tumors with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. As a more robust alternative to cohort-specific thresholds, we showed that with a fixed threshold of 0.25 for all the cohorts, we can rule-out 25.51% in surgical specimens and 6.10% in biopsies.
   Interpretation: When applied in a clinical setting, this means that the AI system can rule out MSI/dMMR in a quarter (with global thresholds) or half of all CRC patients (with local fine-tuning), thereby reducing cost and turnaround time for molecular profiling.

AB The digitalization of data has resulted in a data tsunami in practically every industry of data-driven enterprise. Furthermore, man-to-machine (M2M) digital data handling has dramatically amplified the information wave. There has been a significant development in digital agriculture management applications, which has impacted information and communication technology (ICT) to deliver benefits for both farmers and consumers, as well as pushed technological solutions into rural settings. This paper highlights the potential of ICT technologies in traditional agriculture, as well as the challenges that may arise when they are used in farming techniques. Robotics, Internet of things (IoT) devices, and machine learning issues, as well as the functions of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sensors in agriculture, are all detailed. In addition, drones are being considered for crop observation as well as crop yield optimization management. When applicable, worldwide and cutting-edge IoT-based farming systems and platforms are also highlighted. We do a thorough review of the most recent literature in each area of expertise. We conclude the present and future trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and highlight existing and emerging research problems in AI in agriculture due to this comprehensive assessment.

AB 5G cellular networks are assumed to be the key enabler and infrastructure provider in the ICT industry, by offering a variety of services with diverse requirements. The standardization of 5G cellular networks is being expedited, which also implies more of the candidate technologies will be adopted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide insight into the candidate techniques as a whole and examine the design philosophy behind them. In this article, we try to highlight one of the most fundamental features among the revolutionary techniques in the 5G era, i.e., there emerges initial intelligence in nearly every important aspect of cellular networks, including radio resource management, mobility management, service provisioning management, and so on. However, faced with ever-increasingly complicated configuration issues and blossoming new service requirements, it is still insufficient for 5G cellular networks if it lacks complete AI functionalities. Hence, we further introduce fundamental concepts in AI and discuss the relationship between AI and the candidate techniques in 5G cellular networks. Specifically, we highlight the opportunities and challenges to exploit AI to achieve intelligent 5G networks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of AI to manage and orchestrate cellular network resources. We envision that AI-empowered 5G cellular networks will make the acclaimed ICT enabler a reality.

AB Accurate and reliable water resources planning and management to ensure sustainable use of watershed resources cannot be achieved without precise and reliable models. Notwithstanding the highly stochastic nature of hydrological processes, the development of models capable of describing such complex phenomena is a growing area of research. Providing insight into the modeling of complex phenomena through a thorough overview of the literature, current research, and expanding research horizons can enhance the potential for accurate and well designed models.
   The last couple of decades have seen remarkable progress in the ability to develop accurate hydrologic models. Among various conceptual and black box models developed over this period, hybrid wavelet and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models have been amongst the most promising in simulating hydrologic processes. The present review focuses on defining hybrid modeling, the advantages of such combined models, as well as the history and potential future of their application in hydrology to predict important processes of the hydrologic cycle. Over the years, the use of wavelet-AI models in hydrology has steadily increased and attracted interest given the robustness and accuracy of the approach. This is attributable to the usefulness of wavelet transforms in multi-resolution analysis, de-noising, and edge effect detection over a signal, as well as the strong capability of AI methods in optimization and prediction of processes. Several ideas for future areas of research are also presented in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although deep learning has brought revolutionary changes in health care, reliance on manually selected cross-sectional images and segmentation remain methodological barriers.Purpose: To develop and validate an automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for tumor and lymph node (LN) segmentation with CT imaging for prediction of LN metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with surgically resected, pathologically confirmed PDAC underwent multidetector CT from January 2015 to April 2020. Three models were developed, including an AI model, a clinical model, and a radiomics model. CT-determined LN metastasis was diagnosed by radiologists. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the clinical and radiomics models. The performance of the models was determined on the basis of their discrimination and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, or Cox regression were used for survival analysis.Results: Overall, 734 patients (mean age, 62 years +/- 9 [SD]; 453 men) were evaluated. All patients were split into training (n = 545) and validation (n = 189) sets. Patients who had LN metastasis (LN-positive group) accounted for 340 of 734 (46%) patients. In the training set, the AI model showed the highest performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.91) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.58, 0.76, and 0.71, respectively. In the validation set, the AI model showed the highest performance (AUC, 0.92) in the prediction of LN metastasis, whereas the radiologists and the clinical and radiomics models had AUCs of 0.65, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively (P < .001). AI model-predicted positive LN metastasis was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.89; P = .004).Conclusion: An artificial intelligence model outperformed radiologists and clinical and radiomics models for prediction of lymph node metastasis at CT in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.(c) RSNA, 2022

AB New technologies are transforming medicine, and this revolution starts with data. Health data, clinical images, genome sequences, data on prescribed therapies and results obtained, data that each of us has helped to create. Although the first uses of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine date back to the 1980s, it is only with the beginning of the new millennium that there has been an explosion of interest in this sector worldwide. We are therefore witnessing the exponential growth of health-related information with the result that traditional analysis techniques are not suitable for satisfactorily management of this vast amount of data. AI applications (especially Deep Learning), on the other hand, are naturally predisposed to cope with this explosion of data, as they always work better as the amount of training data increases, a phase necessary to build the optimal neural network for a given clinical problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive and in-depth study of Deep Learning methodologies and applications in medicine. An in-depth analysis of the literature is presented; how, where and why Deep Learning models are applied in medicine are discussed and reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions are outlined and analysed.

AB This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.

AB The last two decades have seen a clear trend toward crafting intelligent vehicles based on the significant advances in communication and computing paradigms, which provide a safer, stress-free, and more enjoyable driving experience. Moreover, emerging applications and services necessitate massive volumes of data, real-time data processing, and ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). However, the computing capability of current intelligent vehicles is minimal, making it challenging to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive demand of such applications. In this situation, vehicular task/computation offloading toward the edge cloud (EC) and vehicular cloudlet (VC) seems to be a promising solution to improve the network's performance and applications' Quality of Service (QoS). At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed people's lives. Especially for vehicular task offloading applications, AI achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vehicular environments. Motivated by the outstanding performance of integrating reinforcement learning (RL)/deep RL (DRL) to the vehicular task offloading systems, we present a survey on various RL/DRL techniques applied to vehicular task offloading. Precisely, we classify the vehicular task offloading works into two main categories: 1) RL/ DRL solutions leveraging EC and 2) RL/DRL solutions using VC computing. Moreover, the EC section-based RL/DRL solutions are further subcategorized into multiaccess edge computing (MEC) server, nearby vehicles, and hybrid MEC (HMEC). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to cover RL/DRL-based vehicular task offloading. Also, we provide lessons learned and open research challenges in this field and discuss the possible trend for future research.

AB Objective To retrieve and appraise studies of deployed artificial intelligence (AI)-based sepsis prediction algorithms using systematic methods, identify implementation barriers, enablers, and key decisions and then map these to a novel end-to-end clinical AI implementation framework. Materials and Methods Systematically review studies of clinically applied AI-based sepsis prediction algorithms in regard to methodological quality, deployment and evaluation methods, and outcomes. Identify contextual factors that influence implementation and map these factors to the SALIENT implementation framework. Results The review identified 30 articles of algorithms applied in adult hospital settings, with 5 studies reporting significantly decreased mortality post-implementation. Eight groups of algorithms were identified, each sharing a common algorithm. We identified 14 barriers, 26 enablers, and 22 decision points which were able to be mapped to the 5 stages of the SALIENT implementation framework. Discussion Empirical studies of deployed sepsis prediction algorithms demonstrate their potential for improving care and reducing mortality but reveal persisting gaps in existing implementation guidance. In the examined publications, key decision points reflecting real-word implementation experience could be mapped to the SALIENT framework and, as these decision points appear to be AI-task agnostic, this framework may also be applicable to non-sepsis algorithms. The mapping clarified where and when barriers, enablers, and key decisions arise within the end-to-end AI implementation process. Conclusions A systematic review of real-world implementation studies of sepsis prediction algorithms was used to validate an end-to-end staged implementation framework that has the ability to account for key factors that warrant attention in ensuring successful deployment, and which extends on previous AI implementation frameworks.

AB Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistin-guishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, dis-ruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these con-tributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.

AB The debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741-742, 1960. 10.1126/science.132.3429.741; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles-the 'what' of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)-rather than on practices, the 'how.' Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community's ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
   Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
   Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

AB ImportanceElectroencephalograms (EEGs) are a fundamental evaluation in neurology but require special expertise unavailable in many regions of the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential for addressing these unmet needs. Previous AI models address only limited aspects of EEG interpretation such as distinguishing abnormal from normal or identifying epileptiform activity. A comprehensive, fully automated interpretation of routine EEG based on AI suitable for clinical practice is needed.ObjectiveTo develop and validate an AI model (Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG-Artificial Intelligence [SCORE-AI]) with the ability to distinguish abnormal from normal EEG recordings and to classify abnormal EEG recordings into categories relevant for clinical decision-making: epileptiform-focal, epileptiform-generalized, nonepileptiform-focal, and nonepileptiform-diffuse.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this multicenter diagnostic accuracy study, a convolutional neural network model, SCORE-AI, was developed and validated using EEGs recorded between 2014 and 2020. Data were analyzed from January 17, 2022, until November 14, 2022. A total of 30 493 recordings of patients referred for EEG were included into the development data set annotated by 17 experts. Patients aged more than 3 months and not critically ill were eligible. The SCORE-AI was validated using 3 independent test data sets: a multicenter data set of 100 representative EEGs evaluated by 11 experts, a single-center data set of 9785 EEGs evaluated by 14 experts, and for benchmarking with previously published AI models, a data set of 60 EEGs with external reference standard. No patients who met eligibility criteria were excluded.Main Outcomes and MeasuresDiagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared with the experts and the external reference standard of patients' habitual clinical episodes obtained during video-EEG recording.ResultsThe characteristics of the EEG data sets include development data set (N = 30 493; 14 980 men; median age, 25.3 years [95% CI, 1.3-76.2 years]), multicenter test data set (N = 100; 61 men, median age, 25.8 years [95% CI, 4.1-85.5 years]), single-center test data set (N = 9785; 5168 men; median age, 35.4 years [95% CI, 0.6-87.4 years]), and test data set with external reference standard (N = 60; 27 men; median age, 36 years [95% CI, 3-75 years]). The SCORE-AI achieved high accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.89 and 0.96 for the different categories of EEG abnormalities, and performance similar to human experts. Benchmarking against 3 previously published AI models was limited to comparing detection of epileptiform abnormalities. The accuracy of SCORE-AI (88.3%; 95% CI, 79.2%-94.9%) was significantly higher than the 3 previously published models (P < .001) and similar to human experts.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, SCORE-AI achieved human expert level performance in fully automated interpretation of routine EEGs. Application of SCORE-AI may improve diagnosis and patient care in underserved areas and improve efficiency and consistency in specialized epilepsy centers.

AB Traditional pathology approaches have played an integral role in the delivery of diagnosis, semi-quantitative or qualitative assessment of protein expression, and classification of disease. Technological advances and the increased focus on precision medicine have recently paved the way for the development of digital pathology-based approaches for quantitative pathologic assessments, namely whole slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, allowing us to explore and extract information beyond human visual perception. Within the field of immuno-oncology, the application of such methodologies in drug development and translational research have created invaluable opportunities for deciphering complex pathophysiology and the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets. With an increasing number of treatment options available for any given disease, practitioners face the growing challenge of selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. The ever-increasing utilization of AI-based approaches substantially expands our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, with digital approaches to patient stratification and selection for diagnostic assays supporting the identification of the optimal treatment regimen based on patient profiles. This review provides an overview of the opportunities and limitations around implementing AI-based methods in biomarker discovery and patient selection and discusses how advances in digital pathology and AI should be considered in the current landscape of translational medicine, touching on challenges this technology may face if adopted in clinical settings. The traditional role of pathologists in delivering accurate diagnoses or assessing biomarkers for companion diagnostics may be enhanced in precision, reproducibility, and scale by AI-powered analysis tools.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing in a manner that blurs the boundaries between specific areas of application and expands its capability to be used in a wide range of applications. The public release of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM), represents a significant step forward in this direction. Accordingly, professionals predict that this technology will affect education, including the role of teachers. However, despite some assumptions regarding its influence on education, how teachers may actually use the technology and the nature of its relationship with teachers remain under-investigated. Thus, in this study, the relationship between ChatGPT and teachers was explored with a particular focus on identifying the complementary roles of each in education. Eleven language teachers were asked to use ChatGPT for their instruction during a period of two weeks. They then participated in individual interviews regarding their experiences and provided interaction logs produced during their use of the technology. Through qualitative analysis of the data, four ChatGPT roles (interlocutor, content provider, teaching assistant, and evaluator) and three teacher roles (orchestrating different resources with quality pedagogical decisions, making students active investigators, and raising AI ethical awareness) were identified. Based on the findings, an in-depth discussion of teacher-AI collaboration is presented, highlighting the importance of teachers' pedagogical expertise when using AI tools. Implications regarding the future use of LLM-powered chatbots in education are also provided.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Statement of problem. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing in dental implant procedures. The current expansion and performance of AI models in implant dentistry applications have not yet been systematically documented and analyzed. Purpose. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the performance of AI models in implant dentistry for implant type recognition, implant success prediction by using patient risk factors and ontology criteria, and implant design optimization combining finite element analysis (FEA) calculations and AI models. Material and methods. An electronic systematic review was completed in 5 databases: MEDLINE/ PubMed, EMBASE, World of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also conducted. Peer-reviewed studies that developed AI models for implant type recognition, implant success prediction, and implant design optimization were included. The search strategy included articles published until February 21, 2021. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (nonrandomized experimental studies). A third investigator was consulted to resolve lack of consensus. Results. Seventeen articles were included: 7 investigations analyzed AI models for implant type recognition, 7 studies included AI prediction models for implant success forecast, and 3 studies evaluated AI models for optimization of implant designs. The AI models developed to recognize implant type by using periapical and panoramic images obtained an overall accuracy outcome ranging from 93.8% to 98%. The models to predict osteointegration success or implant success by using different input data varied among the studies, ranging from 62.4% to 80.5%. Finally, the studies that developed AI models to optimize implant designs seem to agree on the applicability of AI models to improve the design of dental implants. This improvement includes minimizing the stress at the implant-bone interface by 36.6% compared with the finite element model; optimizing the implant design porosity, length, and diameter to improve the finite element calculations; or accurately determining the elastic modulus of the implant-bone interface. Conclusions. AI models for implant type recognition, implant success prediction, and implant design optimization have demonstrated great potential but are still in development. Additional studies are indispensable to the further development and assessment of the clinical performance of AI models for those implant dentistry applications reviewed.

DE Artificial intelligence; Large language models; Systematic review;

AB In this commentary, we discuss ChatGPT and our perspectives on its utility to systematic reviews (SRs) through the appropriateness and applicability of its responses to SR related prompts. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies leave many wondering about the current capabilities, limitations, and opportunities for integration AI into scientific endeavors. Large language models (LLM)-such as ChatGPT, designed by OpenAI-have recently gained widespread attention with their ability to respond to various prompts in a natural-sounding way. Systematic reviews (SRs) utilize secondary data and often require many months and substantial financial resources to complete, making them attractive grounds for developing AI-assistive technologies. On February 6, 2023, PICO Portal developers hosted a webinar to explore ChatGPT's responses to tasks related to SR methodology. Our experience from exploring the responses of ChatGPT suggest that while ChatGPT and LLMs show some promise for aiding in SR-related tasks, the technology is in its infancy and needs much development for such applications. Furthermore, we advise that great caution should be taken by non-content experts in using these tools due to much of the output appearing, at a high level, to be valid, while much is erroneous and in need of active vetting.

AB With the continuing application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in decision-making, algorithmic decision-making is becoming more efficient, often even outperforming humans. Despite this superior performance, people often consciously or unconsciously display reluctance to rely on algorithms, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. Viewed as a behavioral anomaly, algorithm aversion has recently attracted much scholarly attention. With a view to synthesize the findings of existing literature, we systematically review 80 empirical studies identified through searching in seven academic databases and using the snowballing technique. We inductively categorize the influencing factors of algorithm aversion under four main themes: algorithm, individual, task, and high-level. Our analysis reveals that although algorithm and individual factors have been investigated extensively, very little attention has been given to exploring the task and high-level factors. We contribute to algorithm aversion literature by proposing a comprehensive framework, highlighting open issues in existing studies, and outlining several research avenues that could be handled in future research. Our model could guide developers in designing and developing and managers in implementing and using of algorithmic decision.

AB Mobile networks (MNs) are anticipated to provide unprecedented opportunities to enable a new world of connected experiences and radically shift the way people interact with everything. MNs are becoming more and more complex, driven by ever increasing complicated configuration issues and blossoming new service requirements. This complexity poses significant challenges in deployment, management, operation, optimization, and maintenance, since they require complete understanding and cognition of MNs. Artificial intelligence (AI), which deals with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, has demonstrated enormous success in many application domains, suggesting its potential in cognizing the state of an MN and making intelligent decisions. In this article, we first propose an AI-powered MN architecture and discuss challenges in terms of cognition complexity, decisions with high-dimensional action space, and self-adaptation to system dynamics. Then potential solutions associated with AI are discussed. Finally, we propose a deep learning approach that directly maps the state of an MN to perceived QoS, integrating cognition with the decision. Our proposed approach helps operators to make more intelligent decisions to guarantee QoS. Meanwhile, the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed approach are demonstrated on a real-world dataset involving 31,261 users over 77 stations within 5 days.

AB Deep learning is the state-of-the-art machine learning approach. The success of deep learning in many pattern recognition applications has brought excitement and high expectations that deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), can bring revolutionary changes in health care. Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deep-learning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.

AB This paper presents a vision for a Disaster City Digital Twin paradigm that can: (i) enable interdisciplinary convergence in the field of crisis informatics and information and communication technology (ICT) in disaster management; (ii) integrate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and approaches to improve situation assessment, decision making, and coordination among various stakeholders; and (iii) enable increased visibility into network dynamics of complex disaster management and humanitarian actions. The number of humanitarian relief actions is growing due to the increased frequency of natural and man-made crises. Various streams of research across different disciplines have focused on ICT and AI solutions for enhancing disaster management processes. However, most of the existing research is fragmented without a common vision towards a converging paradigm. Recognizing this, this paper presents the Disaster City Digital Twin as a unifying paradigm. The four main components of the proposed Digital Twin paradigm include: multi-data sensing for data collection, data integration and analytics, multi-actor game-theoretic decision making, and dynamic network analysis. For each component, the current state of the art related to AI methods and approaches are examined and gaps are identified.

AB It has become rapidly clear in the past few years that the creation, use and maintenance of high-quality annotated datasets for robust and reliable AI applications requires careful attention. This Perspective discusses challenges, considerations and best practices for various stages in the data-to-AI pipeline, to encourage a more data-centric approach.
   As artificial intelligence (AI) transitions from research to deployment, creating the appropriate datasets and data pipelines to develop and evaluate AI models is increasingly the biggest challenge. Automated AI model builders that are publicly available can now achieve top performance in many applications. In contrast, the design and sculpting of the data used to develop AI often rely on bespoke manual work, and they critically affect the trustworthiness of the model. This Perspective discusses key considerations for each stage of the data-for-AI pipeline-starting from data design to data sculpting (for example, cleaning, valuation and annotation) and data evaluation-to make AI more reliable. We highlight technical advances that help to make the data-for-AI pipeline more scalable and rigorous. Furthermore, we discuss how recent data regulations and policies can impact AI.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced substantially in recent years, transforming many industries and improving the way people live and work. In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers. Methods: This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles.Results: The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references.Conclusions: The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing.

AB Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital energy-storage devices in modern society. However, the performance and cost are still not satisfactory in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, etc. To further improve the performance of batteries, traditional "trial-and-error" processes require a vast number of tedious experiments. Computational chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly accelerate the research and development of novel battery systems. Herein, a heterogeneous category of AI technology for predicting and discovering battery materials and estimating the state of the battery system is reviewed. Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real-world scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined. The state-of-the-art research about the applications of ML in the property prediction and battery discovery, including electrolyte and electrode materials, are further summarized. Meanwhile, the prediction of battery states is also provided. Finally, various existing challenges and the framework to tackle the challenges on the further development of machine learning for rechargeable LIBs are proposed.

DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.

AB Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.

AB In the wake of media hype about artificial intelligence (AI)/human collaboration, organizations are investing considerable resources into developing and using AI. In this paper, we draw on theories of technology in organizations to frame new directions for the study of what it means to work "with" AI. Drawing on prior literature, we consider how interactions between users and AI might unfold through theoretical lenses which cast technology as a tool and as a medium. Reflecting on how AI technologies diverge from technologies studied in the past, we propose a new perspective, which considers technology as a counterpart in a system of work that includes its design, implementation, and use. This perspective encourages developing a grounded understanding of how AI intersects with work, and therefore ethnography, building on thick descriptions, is an apt approach. We argue that relational ethnographic approaches can assist organization theorists in navigating the methodological challenges of taking a counterpart perspective and propose several strategies for future research.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) has multifaceted applications due to its worldly usage of acquisition devices such as smartphones, video cameras, and its ability to capture human activity data. While electronic devices and their applications are steadily growing, the advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the ability to extract deep hidden information for accurate detection and its interpretation. This yields a better understanding of rapidly growing acquisition devices, AI, and applications, the three pillars of HAR under one roof. There are many review articles published on the general characteristics of HAR, a few have compared all the HAR devices at the same time, and few have explored the impact of evolving AI architecture. In our proposed review, a detailed narration on the three pillars of HAR is presented covering the period from 2011 to 2021. Further, the review presents the recommendations for an improved HAR design, its reliability, and stability. Five major findings were: (1) HAR constitutes three major pillars such as devices, AI and applications; (2) HAR has dominated the healthcare industry; (3) Hybrid AI models are in their infancy stage and needs considerable work for providing the stable and reliable design. Further, these trained models need solid prediction, high accuracy, generalization, and finally, meeting the objectives of the applications without bias; (4) little work was observed in abnormality detection during actions; and (5) almost no work has been done in forecasting actions. We conclude that: (a) HAR industry will evolve in terms of the three pillars of electronic devices, applications and the type of AI. (b) AI will provide a powerful impetus to the HAR industry in future.

ID DATABASE
AB The COVID-19 diagnostic approach is mainly divided into two broad categories, a laboratory-based and chest radiography approach. The last few months have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of studies use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to diagnose COVID-19 with chest computed tomography (CT). In this study, we review the diagnosis of COVID-19 by using chest CT toward AI. We searched ArXiv, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar using the terms "deep learning", "neural networks", "COVID-19", and "chest CT". At the time of writing (August 24, 2020), there have been nearly 100 studies and 30 studies among them were selected for this review. We categorized the studies based on the classification tasks: COVID-19/normal, COVID-19/non-COVID-19, COVID-19/non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and severity. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, area under the curve, and F1 score results were reported as high as 100%, 100%, 99.62, 99.87%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. However, the presented results should be carefully compared due to the different degrees of difficulty of different classification tasks.

AB The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people's trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition tomodel development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have received considerable attention during the last few years. However, little is known concerning what affects their use for educational purposes. This research, therefore, develops a theoretical model based on extracting constructs from the expectation confirmation model (ECM) (expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction), combined with the knowledge management (KM) factors (knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge application) to understand the sustainable use of chatbots. The developed model was then tested based on data collected through an online survey from 448 university students who used chatbots for learning purposes. Contrary to the prior literature that mainly relied on structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, the empirical data were analyzed using a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. The hypotheses testing results reinforced all the suggested hypotheses in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that knowledge application has the most considerable effect on the sustainable use of chatbots with 96.9% normalized importance, followed by perceived usefulness (70.7%), knowledge acquisition (69.3%), satisfaction (61%), and knowledge sharing (19.6%). Deriving from these results, the study highlighted a number of practical implications that benefit developers, designers, service providers, and instructors.

AB RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL neural networks was motivated by the observation that human intelligence emerges from highly parallel networks of relatively simple, non-linear neurons that learn by adjusting the strengths of their connections. This observation leads to a central computational question: How is it possible for networks of this general kind to learn the complicated internal representations that are required for difficult tasks such as recognizing.

AB The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased since the middle of the 20th century as seen in its application in a wide range of engineering and science problems. The last two decades, for example, has seen a dramatic increase in the development and application of various types of Al approaches for stream-flow forecasting. Generally speaking, Al has exhibited significant progress in forecasting and modeling non-linear hydrological applications and in capturing the noise complexity in the dataset. This paper explores the state-of-the-art application of Al in stream-flow forecasting, focusing on defining the data-driven of Al, the advantages of complementary models, as well as the literature and their possible future application in modeling and forecasting stream-flow. The review also identifies the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research, including, a new scheme for modeling the inflow, a novel method for preprocessing time series frequency based on Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) techniques, and Swarm Intelligence (SI) as an optimization approach.

AB The present study is done to perform the optimal design of the structural components of the buildings against the unwanted wind load exerted on their outer face. To this end, the case study of the research is the outer wall made of a one-floor building modeled as a rectangular plate with only one free edge and three clamped ones. It is assumed that the wall is a sandwich plate whose core is made of auxetic material and dace-sheets are reinforced with nanoparticles of graphene platelets (GPL). Differential equations governing the system's motion are obtained within the background of the plate's shear-deformation theories. The stability analysis of the sandwich wall is performed based on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods optimized with an innovative optimization approach to gain a high level of accuracy. To determine the stability information of the system at the train points, the differential quadrature approach (DQA) is applied as the solver of differential equations of motion. The accuracy of the methods used in this paper is examined and verified by comparing the results with those acquired in the articles published previously. The results obtained in this study provide very useful information about the stability response of lightweight building components through AI-based solutions.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly around the world, resulting in a massive death toll. Lung infection or pneumonia is the common complication of COVID-19, and imaging techniques, especially computed tomography (CT), have played an important role in diagnosis and treatment assessment of the disease. Herein, we review the imaging characteristics and computing models that have been applied for the management of COVID-19. CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up. The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored. Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19. In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.

ID EXPLANATION
AB Dramatic success in machine learning has led to a new wave of AI applications (for example, transportation, security, medicine, finance, defense) that offer tremendous benefits but cannot explain their decisions and actions to human users. DARPA's explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program endeavors to create AI systems whose learned models and decisions can be understood and appropriately trusted by end users. Realizing this goal requires methods for learning more explainable models, designing effective explanation interfaces, and understanding the psychologic requirements for effective explanations. The XAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human-computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4-year program in May 2018. In a series of ongoing evaluations, the developer teams are assessing how well their XAM systems' explanations improve user understanding, user trust, and user task performance.

AB Smart manufacturing refers to optimization techniques that are implemented in production operations by utilizing advanced analytics approaches. With the widespread increase in deploying industrial internet of things (IIOT) sensors in manufacturing processes, there is a progressive need for optimal and effective approaches to data management. Embracing machine learning and artificial intelligence to take advantage of manufacturing data can lead to efficient and intelligent automation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis based on evolutionary computing and neural network algorithms toward making semiconductor manufacturing smart. We propose a dynamic algorithm for gaining useful insights about semiconductor manufacturing processes and to address various challenges. We elaborate on the utilization of a genetic algorithm and neural network to propose an intelligent feature selection algorithm. Our objective is to provide an advanced solution for controlling manufacturing processes and to gain perspective on various dimensions that enable manufacturers to access effective predictive technologies.

TI AI Improves Nodule Detection on Chest Radiographs in a Health Screening
   Population: A Randomized Controlled Trial
SO RADIOLOGY

AB Background: The impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided detection (CAD) software has not been prospectively explored in real-world populations.Purpose: To investigate whether commercial AI-based CAD software could improve the detection rate of actionable lung nodules on chest radiographs in participants undergoing health checkups.Materials and Methods: In this single-center, pragmatic, open-label randomized controlled trial, participants who underwent chest radiography between July 2020 and December 2021 in a health screening center were enrolled and randomized into intervention (AI group) and control (non-AI group) arms. One of three designated radiologists with 13-36 years of experience interpreted each radiograph, referring to the AI-based CAD results for the AI group. The primary outcome was the detection rate, that is, the number of true-positive radiographs divided by the total number of radiographs, of actionable lung nodules confirmed on CT scans obtained within 3 months. Actionable nodules were defined as solid nodules larger than 8 mm or subsolid nodules with a solid portion larger than 6 mm (Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System, or Lung-RADS, category 4). Secondary outcomes included the positive-report rate, sensitivity, false-referral rate, and malignant lung nodule detection rate. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups using univariable logistic regression analyses.Results: A total of 10 476 participants (median age, 59 years [IQR, 50-66 years]; 5121 men) were randomized to an AI group (n = 5238) or non-AI group (n = 5238). The trial met the predefined primary outcome, demonstrating an improved detection rate of actionable nodules in the AI group compared with the non-AI group (0.59% [31 of 5238 participants] vs 0.25% [13 of 5238 participants], respectively; odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.7; P = .008). The detection rate for malignant lung nodules was higher in the AI group compared with the non-AI group (0.15% [eight of 5238 participants] vs 0.0% [0 of 5238 participants], respectively; P = .008). The AI and non-AI groups showed similar false-referral rates (45.9% [56 of 122 participants] vs 56.0% [56 of 100 participants], respectively; P = .14) and positive-report rates (2.3% [122 of 5238 participants] vs 1.9% [100 of 5238 participants]; P = .14).Conclusion: In health checkup participants, artificial intelligence-based software improved the detection of actionable lung nodules on chest radiographs.

AB Shear connectors play a prominent role in the design of steel-concrete composite systems. The behavior of shear connectors is generally determined through conducting push-out tests. However, these tests are costly and require plenty of time. As an alternative approach, soft computing (SC) can be used to eliminate the need for conducting push-out tests. This study aims to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, as sub-branches of SC methods, in the behavior prediction of an innovative type of C-shaped shear connectors, called Tilted Angle Connectors. For this purpose, several push-out tests are conducted on these connectors and the required data for the AI models are collected. Then, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to identify the most influencing parameters on the shear strength of the tilted angle connectors. Totally, six different models are created based on the ANFIS results. Finally, AI techniques such as an artificial neural network (ANN), an extreme learning machine (ELM), and another ANFIS are employed to predict the shear strength of the connectors in each of the six models. The results of the paper show that slip is the most influential factor in the shear strength of tilted connectors and after that, the inclination angle is the most effective one. Moreover, it is deducted that considering only four parameters in the predictive models is enough to have a very accurate prediction. It is also demonstrated that ELM needs less time and it can reach slightly better performance indices than those of ANN and ANFIS.

AB Over the last decade, deep learning (DL) methods have been extremely successful and widely used to develop artificial intelligence (AI) in almost every domain, especially after it achieved its proud record on computational Go. Compared to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, DL methods still have a long way to go to achieve recognition in small molecular drug discovery and development. And there is still lots of work to do for the popularization and application of DL for research purpose, e.g., for small molecule drug research and development. In this review, we mainly discussed several most powerful and mainstream architectures, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and deep auto-encoder networks (DAENs), for supervised learning and nonsupervised learning; summarized most of the representative applications in small molecule drug design; and briefly introduced how DL methods were used in those applications. The discussion for the pros and cons of DL methods as well as the main challenges we need to tackle were also emphasized.

AB Autonomous ships are expected to improve the level of safety and efficiency in future maritime navigation. Such vessels need perception for two purposes: to perform autonomous situational awareness and to monitor the integrity of the sensor system itself. In order to meet these needs, the perception system must fuse data from novel and traditional perception sensors using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This article overviews the recognized operational requirements that are imposed on regular and autonomous seafaring vessels, and then proceeds to consider suitable sensors and relevant AI techniques for an operational sensor system. The integration of four sensors families is considered: sensors for precise absolute positioning (Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), visual sensors (monocular and stereo cameras), audio sensors (microphones), and sensors for remote-sensing (RADAR and LiDAR). Additionally, sources of auxiliary data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) and external data archives are discussed. The perception tasks are related to well-defined problems, such as situational abnormality detection, vessel classification, and localization, that are solvable using AI techniques. Machine learning methods, such as deep learning and Gaussian processes, are identified to be especially relevant for these problems. The different sensors and AI techniques are characterized keeping in view the operational requirements, and some example state-of-the-art options are compared based on accuracy, complexity, required resources, compatibility and adaptability to maritime environment, and especially towards practical realization of autonomous systems.

AB Statement of problem. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for periodontal applications, including diagnosing gingivitis and periodontal disease, but their accuracy and maturity of the technology remain unclear.Purpose. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the performance of the AI models for detecting dental plaque and diagnosing gingivitis and periodontal disease.Material and methods. A review was performed in 4 databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, World of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also conducted. Studies were classified into 4 groups: detecting dental plaque, diagnosis of gingivitis, diagnosis of periodontal disease from intraoral images, and diagnosis of alveolar bone loss from periapical, bitewing, and panoramic radiographs. Two investigators evaluated the studies independently by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal. A third examiner was consulted to resolve any lack of consensus.Results. Twenty-four articles were included: 2 studies developed AI models for detecting plaque, resulting in accuracy ranging from 73.6% to 99%; 7 studies assessed the ability to diagnose gingivitis from intraoral photographs reporting an accuracy between 74% and 78.20%; 1 study used fluorescent intraoral images to diagnose gingivitis reporting 67.7% to 73.72% accuracy; 3 studies assessed the ability to diagnose periodontal disease from intraoral photographs with an accuracy between 47% and 81%, and 11 studies evaluated the performance of AI models for detecting alveolar bone loss from radiographic images reporting an accuracy between 73.4% and 99%.Conclusions. AI models for periodontology applications are still in development but might provide a powerful diagnostic tool. (J Prosthet Dent 2023;130:816-24)

AB Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) more broadly have great immediate and future potential for transforming almost all aspects of medicine. However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians. We propose some guidelines for the implementation of XAI in CDSS and explore some opportunities, challenges, and future research needs.

AB Background Mammography is the current standard for breast cancer screening. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography, and explore whether it could benefit radiologists by improving accuracy of diagnosis.
   Methods In this retrospective study, an AI algorithm was developed and validated with 170 230 mammography examinations collected from five institutions in South Korea, the USA, and the UK, including 36 468 cancer positive confirmed by biopsy, 59 544 benign confirmed by biopsy (8827 mammograms) or follow-up imaging (50 717 mammograms), and 74 218 normal. For the multicentre, observer-blinded, reader study, 320 mammograms (160 cancer positive, 64 benign, 96 normal) were independently obtained from two institutions. 14 radiologists participated as readers and assessed each mammogram in terms of likelihood of malignancy (LOM), location of malignancy, and necessity to recall the patient, first without and then with assistance of the AI algorithm. The performance of AI and radiologists was evaluated in terms of LOM-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall-based sensitivity and specificity.
   Findings The AI standalone performance was AUROC 0.959 (95% CI 0.952-0.966) overall, and 0.970 (0.963-0.978) in the South Korea dataset, 0.953 (0.938-0.968) in the USA dataset, and 0.938 (0.918-0.958) in the UK dataset. In the reader study, the performance level of AI was 0.940 (0.915-0.965), significantly higher than that of the radiologists without AI assistance ( 0.810, 95% CI 0.770-0.850; p<0.0001). With the assistance of AI, radiologists' performance was improved to 0.881 (0.850-0.911; p<0.0001). AI was more sensitive to detect cancers with mass (53 [90%] vs 46 [78%] of 59 cancers detected; p=0.044) or distortion or asymmetry (18 [90%] vs ten [50%] of 20 cancers detected; p=0.023) than radiologists. AI was better in detection of T1 cancers (73 [91%] vs 59 [74%] of 80; p=0.0039) or node-negative cancers (104 [87%] vs 88 [74%] of 119; p=0.0025) than radiologists.
   Interpretation The AI algorithm developed with large-scale mammography data showed better diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection compared with radiologists. The significant improvement in radiologists' performance when aided by AI supports application of AI to mammograms as a diagnostic support tool. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB This paper discusses the use of Artificial Intelligence Chatbot in scientific writing. ChatGPT is a type of chatbot, developed by OpenAI, that uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model to understand and respond to natural language inputs. AI chatbot and ChatGPT in particular appear to be useful tools in scientific writing, assisting researchers and scientists in organizing material, generating an initial draft and/or in proofreading. There is no publication in the field of critical care medicine prepared using this approach; however, this will be a possibility in the next future. ChatGPT work should not be used as a replacement for human judgment and the output should always be reviewed by experts before being used in any critical decision-making or application. Moreover, several ethical issues arise about using these tools, such as the risk of plagiarism and inaccuracies, as well as a potential imbalance in its accessibility between high- and low-income countries, if the software becomes paying. For this reason, a consensus on how to regulate the use of chatbots in scientific writing will soon be required.

AB COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of lives. Due to COVID-19 & x2019;s spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.

AB Waste disposal was a significant challenge faced by the community and government. Customers buy and use goods that produce a considerable amount of waste. Waste management is a major problem since the number of consumers increased due to high waste generation. This has resulted in a huge amount of waste, which calls for enormous waste-management policies. Reduce; Reuse, Recycle, and Recover are the tools to reduce the adverse implications of retailing and manufacturing on the environment. In this paper, Artificial Intelligence based Hybridized Intelligent Framework (AIHIF) has been proposed for automated recycling to optimizing the waste management process. The system will optimize waste collection with a short distance by utilizing machine learning and graph theory. AI design technology, which helps different approaches adapted to interest groups, collecting their specific information and greatly improving environmental planning and urban management performance, accuracy, and efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances performance and accuracy when compared to other existing methods.

AB The new era of nanomedicine offers significant opportunities for cancer diagnostics and treatment. Magnetic nanoplatforms could be highly effective tools for cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future. Due to their tunable morphologies and superior properties, multifunctional magnetic nanomaterials and their hybrid nanostructures can be designed as specific carriers of drugs, imaging agents, and magnetic theranostics. Multifunctional magnetic nanostructures are promising theranostic agents due to their ability to diagnose and combine therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of advanced multifunctional magnetic nanostructures combining magnetic and optical properties, providing photoresponsive magnetic platforms for promising medical applications. Moreover, this review discusses various innovative developments using multifunctional magnetic nanostructures, including drug delivery, cancer treatment, tumor-specific ligands that deliver chemotherapeutics or hormonal agents, magnetic resonance imaging, and tissue engineering. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to optimize material properties in cancer diagnosis and treatment, based on predicted interactions with drugs, cell membranes, vasculature, biological fluid, and the immune system to enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of AI approaches used to assess the practical utility of multifunctional magnetic nanostructures for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the review presents the current knowledge and perspectives on hybrid magnetic systems as cancer treatment tools with AI models.

AB This study aims to identify how environmental, technological, and social factors influence the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing. The Industry 4.0 era has brought a breakthrough in advanced technologies in fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless technology, fully autonomous vehicles, 3D printing and so on. In this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. In doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework is used to explore the applicability of Industry 4.0. A conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations. The results further indicated that leadership support acts as a countable factor to moderate such an adoption.

AB OBJECTIVE To examine the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection of breast cancer in mammography screening practice. DESIGN Systematic review of test accuracy studies. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women's digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. STUDY SELECTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. RESULTS Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity. STUDY REGISTRATION Protocol registered as PROSPERO CRD42020213590.

AB This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical model of artificially intelligent (AI) device use acceptance (AIDUA) that aims to explain customers' willingness to accept AI device use in service encounters. The proposed model incorporates three acceptance generation stages (primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and outcome stage) and six antecedents (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and emotion). Utilizing data collected from potential customers, the proposed AIDUA model is tested. Findings suggest that customers go through a three-step acceptance generation process in determining whether to accept the use of AI devices during their service interactions. Findings indicate that social influence and hedonic motivation are positively related to performance expectancy while anthropomorphism is positively related to effort expectancy. Both performance and effort expectancy are significant antecedents of customer emotions, which determines customers' acceptance of AI device use in service encounters. This study provides a conceptual AI device acceptance framework that can be used by other researchers to better investigate AI related topics in the service context.

AB Rapid advancements of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) technology pave the way for developing a digital-twin-based remote interactive system for advanced robotic-enabled industrial automation and virtual shopping. The embedded multifunctional perception system is urged for better interaction and user experience. To realize such a system, a smart soft robotic manipulator is presented that consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator tactile (T-TENG) and length (L-TENG) sensor, as well as a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) pyroelectric temperature sensor. With the aid of machine learning (ML) for data processing, the fusion of the T-TENG and L-TENG sensors can realize the automatic recognition of the grasped objects with the accuracy of 97.143% for 28 different shapes of objects, while the temperature distribution can also be obtained through the pyroelectric sensor. By leveraging the IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics, a digital-twin-based virtual shop is successfully implemented to provide the users with real-time feedback about the details of the product. In general, by offering a more immersive experience in human-machine interactions, the proposed remote interactive system shows the great potential of being the advanced human-machine interface for the applications of the unmanned working space.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this review of the FL-IoT services and applications are also highlighted. We complete this survey by highlighting the current challenges and possible directions for future research in this booming area.

AB While AI has benefited humans, it may also harm humans if not appropriately developed. The priority of current HCI work should focus on transiting from conventional human interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals addressing these new issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of these methods in support of developing HCAI systems. We propose the alternative methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also offer strategic recommendation for HCI professionals to effectively influence the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing HCAI systems.

AB Through the advancement of observation systems, our vision has far extended its reach into the world of fishes, and how they interact with fishing gears-breaking through physical boundaries and visually adapting to challenging conditions in marine environments. As marine sciences step into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning models now provide tools for researchers to process a large amount of imagery data (i.e., image sequence, video) on fish behavior in a more time-efficient and cost-effective manner. The latest AI models to detect fish and categorize species are now reaching human-like accuracy. Nevertheless, robust tools to track fish movements in situ are under development and primarily focused on tropical species. Data to accurately interpret fish interactions with fishing gears is still lacking, especially for temperate fishes. At the same time, this is an essential step for selectivity studies to advance and integrate AI methods in assessing the effectiveness of modified gears. We here conduct a bibliometric analysis to review the recent advances and applications of AI in automated tools for fish tracking, classification, and behavior recognition, highlighting how they may ultimately help improve gear selectivity. We further show how transforming external stimuli that influence fish behavior, such as sensory cues and gears as background, into interpretable features that models learn to distinguish remains challenging. By presenting the recent advances in AI on fish behavior applied to fishing gear improvements (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), coupled networks), we discuss the advances, potential and limits of AI to help meet the demands of fishing policies and sustainable goals, as scientists and developers continue to collaborate in building the database needed to train deep learning models.

AB Background: Missed fractures are a common cause of diagnostic discrepancy between initial radiographic interpretation and the final read by board-certified radiologists.
   Purpose: To assess the effect of assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on radiographs.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective diagnostic study used the multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set (n = 480), with and without AI assistance, with a 1-month minimum washout period. The primary analysis had to demonstrate superiority of sensitivity per patient and the noninferiority of specificity per patient at 23% margin with AI aid. Stand-alone AI performance was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results: A total of 480 patients were included (mean age, 59 years 6 16 [standard deviation]; 327 women). The sensitivity per patient was 10.4% higher (95% CI: 6.9, 13.9; P,.001 for superiority) with AI aid (4331 of 5760 readings, 75.2%) than without AI (3732 of 5760 readings, 64.8%). The specificity per patient with AI aid (5504 of 5760 readings, 95.6%) was noninferior to that without AI aid (5217 of 5760 readings, 90.6%), with a difference of 15.0% (95% CI: 12.0, 18.0; P =.001 for noninferiority). AI shortened the average reading time by 6.3 seconds per examination (95% CI: 212.5, 20.1; P =.046). The sensitivity by patient gain was significant in all regions (18.0% to 116.2%; P<.05) but shoulder and clavicle and spine (14.2% and 12.6%; P =.12 and.52).
   Conclusion: AI assistance improved the sensitivity and may even improve the specificity of fracture detection by radiologists and nonradiologists, without lengthening reading time. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license

AB Modern agriculture and food production systems are facing increasing pressures from climate change, land and water availability, and, more recently, a pandemic. These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools. This review focuses on the use of recent technological advances in remote sensing and AI to improve the resilience of agricultural systems, and we will present a unique opportunity for the development of prescriptive tools needed to address the next decade's agricultural and human nutrition challenges.

AB Artificial intelligence technology has been increasingly applied in the hospitality and tourism industry, and it is a matter of concern how to increase customer adoption of AI applications in service encounters. This study examines how cuteness of AI applications interacts with the type of service task (emotional or knowledge-based) in their influence on customers' willingness to use the application. Hypotheses were tested using four experiments in different interactive contexts. It was found that customers were more willing to adopt AI applications with high perceived cuteness to perform emotional tasks, and social distance played a mediating role; conversely, customers preferred AI applications with low perceived cuteness to perform knowledge-based tasks, and here performance expectancy mediated the relationship between perceived cuteness and customers' willingness to use the application. The findings advance the theories of customer adoption by revealing and differentiating the "cuteness effect" within different service types.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into "black box" approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.

AB Recently, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become one of the most active research fields in both academic and industry, which exploits resources of vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) to execute various vehicular applications. Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the asymmetrical distribution of traffic flows, it is essential for the network operator to design intelligent offloading strategies to improve network performance and provide high-quality services for users. However, the lack of global information and the time-variety of IoVs make it challenging to perform effective offloading and caching decisions under long-term energy constraints of RSUs. Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can greatly enhance the intelligence and the performance of IoVs, we push AI inspired computing, caching and communication resources to the proximity of smart vehicles, which jointly enable RSU peer offloading, vehicle-to-RSU offloading and content caching in the IoV framework. A Mix Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to minimize total network delay, consisting of communication delay, computation delay, network congestion delay and content downloading delay of all users. Then, we develop an online multi-decision making scheme (named OMEN) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization method to solve the formulated problem, and prove that OMEN achieves near-optimal performance. Leveraging strong cognition of AI, we put forward an imitation learning enabled branch-and-bound solution in edge intelligent IoVs to speed up the problem solving process with few training samples.

AB Clinical trials consume the latter half of the 10 to 15 year, 1.5-2.0 billion USD, development cycle for bringing a single new drug to market. Hence, a failed trial sinks not only the investment into the trial itself but also the preclinical development costs, rendering the loss per failed clinical trial at 800 million to 1.4 billion USD. Suboptimal patient cohort selection and recruiting techniques, paired with the inability to monitor patients effectively during trials, are two of the main causes for high trial failure rates: only one of 10 compounds entering a clinical trial reaches the market. We explain how recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to reshape key steps of clinical trial design towards increasing trial success rates.

AB The past decade has seen significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI), which has resulted in algorithms being adopted for resolving a variety of problems. However, this success has been met by increasing model complexity and employing black-box AI models that lack transparency. In response to this need, Explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to make AI more transparent and thus advance the adoption of AI in critical domains. Although there are several reviews of XAI topics in the literature that have identified challenges and potential research directions of XAI, these challenges and research directions are scattered. This study, hence, presents a systematic meta-survey of challenges and future research directions in XAI organized in two themes: (1) general challenges and research directions of XAI and (2) challenges and research directions of XAI based on machine learning life cycle's phases: design, development, and deployment. We believe that our meta-survey contributes to XAI literature by providing a guide for future exploration in the XAI area .(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this letter, a novel autonomous control framework "Grid Mind" is proposed for the secure operation of power grids based on cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The proposed platform provides a data-driven, model-free and closed-loop control agent trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms by interacting with massive simulations and/or real environment of a power grid. The proposed agent learns from scratch to master the power grid voltage control problem purely from data. It can make autonomous voltage control (AVC) strategies to support grid operators in making effective and timely control actions, according to the current system conditions detected by real-time measurements from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or phasor measurement units (PMUs). Two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely deep Q-network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), are proposed to formulate the AVC problem with performance compared. Case studies on a realistic 200-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of the proposed framework.

AB In the current era, interacting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an everyday activity. Understanding the interaction between humans and AI is of potential value because, in future, such interactions are expected to become more pervasive. Two studies-one survey and one experiment-were conducted to demonstrate positive effects of anthropomorphism on interactions with smart-speaker-based AI assistants and to examine the mediating role of psychological distance in this relationship. The results of Study 1, an online survey, showed that participants with a higher tendency to anthropomorphize their AI assistant/s evaluated it/them more positively, and this effect was mediated by psychological distance. In Study 2, the hypotheses were tested in a more sophisticated experiment. Again, the results indicated that, in the high-anthropomorphism (vs. low anthropomorphism) condition, participants had more positive attitudes toward the AI assistant, and the effect was mediated by psychological distance. Though several studies have demonstrated the effect of anthropomorphism, few have probed the underlying mechanism of anthropomorphism thoroughly. The current research not only contributes to the anthropomorphism literature, but also provides direction to research on facilitating human-AI interaction.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.

AB Background Artificial intelligence (AI) tools increase detection of precancerous polyps during colonoscopy and might contribute to long-term colorectal cancer prevention. The aim of the study was to investigate the incremental effect of the implementation of AI detection tools in screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and the cost-effectiveness of such tools.
   Methods We conducted Markov model microsimulation of using colonoscopy with and without AI for colorectal cancer screening for individuals at average risk (no personal or family history of colorectal cancer, adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, or hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome). We ran the microsimulation in a hypothetical cohort of 100000 individuals in the USA aged 50-100 years. The primary analysis investigated screening colonoscopy with versus without AI every 10 years starting at age 50 years and finishing at age 80 years, with follow-up until age 100 years, assuming 60% screening population uptake. In secondary analyses, we modelled once-in-life screening colonoscopy at age 65 years in adults aged 50-79 years at average risk for colorectal cancer. Post-polypectomy surveillance followed the simplified current guideline. Costs of AI tools and cost for downstream treatment of screening detected disease were estimated with 3% annual discount rates. The main outcome measures included the incremental effect of AI-assisted colonoscopy versus standard (no-AI) colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and cost-effectiveness of screening projected for the average risk screening US population.
   Findings In the primary analyses, compared with no screening, the relative reduction of colorectal cancer incidence with screening colonoscopy without AI tools was 44.2% and with screening colonoscopy with AI tools was 48.9% (4.8% incremental gain). Compared with no screening, the relative reduction in colorectal cancer mortality with screening colonoscopy with no AI was 48.7% and with screening colonoscopy with AI was 52.3% (3.6% incremental gain). AI detection tools decreased the discounted costs per screened individual from $3400 to $3343 (a saving of $57 per individual). Results were similar in the secondary analyses modelling once-in-life colonoscopy. At the US population level, the implementation of AI detection during screening colonoscopy resulted in yearly additional prevention of 7194 colorectal cancer cases and 2089 related deaths, and a yearly saving of US$290 million.
   Interpretation Our findings suggest that implementation of AI detection tools in screening colonoscopy is a cost-saving strategy to further prevent colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics is now a global topic of discussion in academic and policy circles. At least 84 public-private initiatives have produced statements describing high-level principles, values and other tenets to guide the ethical development, deployment and governance of AI. According to recent meta-analyses, AI ethics has seemingly converged on a set of principles that closely resemble the four classic principles of medical ethics. Despite the initial credibility granted to a principled approach to AI ethics by the connection to principles in medical ethics, there are reasons to be concerned about its future impact on AI development and governance. Significant differences exist between medicine and AI development that suggest a principled approach for the latter may not enjoy success comparable to the former. Compared to medicine, AI development lacks (1) common aims and fiduciary duties, (2) professional history and norms, (3) proven methods to translate principles into practice, and (4) robust legal and professional accountability mechanisms. These differences suggest we should not yet celebrate consensus around high-level principles that hide deep political and normative disagreement. AI ethics initiatives have seemingly converged on a set of principles that closely resemble the four classic principles of medical ethics. Despite this, Brent Mittelstadt highlights important differences between medical practice and AI development that suggest a principled approach may not work in the case of AI.

AB Reservoirs and dams are vital human-built infrastructures that play essential roles in flood control, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, navigation, and other functions. The realization of those functions requires efficient reservoir operation, and the effective controls on the outflow from a reservoir or dam. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of streamflow forecasts, reservoir operation planning and scheduling approaches. In this study, three AI models, namely, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) technique, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed to simulate reservoir operation at monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, using approximately 30 years of historical reservoir operation records. This study aims to summarize the influence of the parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to reservoir operation simulation. The results show the following: (1) for the BP neural network and LSTM model, the effects of the number of maximum iterations on model performance should be prioritized; for the SVR model, the simulation performance is directly related to the selection of the kernel function, and sigmoid and RBF kernel functions should be prioritized; (2) the BP neural network and SVR are suitable for the model to learn the operation rules of a reservoir from a small amount of data; and (3) the LSTM model is able to effectively reduce the time consumption and memory storage required by other AI models, and demonstrate good capability in simulating low-flow conditions and the outflow curve for the peak operation period.

AB The rapid development of human population, buildings and technology application currently has caused electric consumption to grow rapidly. Therefore, efficient energy management and forecasting energy consumption for buildings are important in decision-making for effective energy saving and development in particular places. This paper reviews the building electrical energy forecasting method using artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Both methods are widely used in the field of forecasting and their aim on finding the most accurate approach is ever continuing. Besides the already existing single method of forecasting, the hybridization of the two forecasting methods has the potential to be applied for more accurate results. Further research works are currently ongoing, regarding the potential of hybrid method of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), or known as GLSSVM, to forecast building electrical energy consumption.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that simulates the structures and operating principles of the human brain. Machine learning (ML) belongs to the area of AI and endeavors to develop models from exposure to training data. Deep Learning (DL) is another subset of AI, where models represent geometric transformations over many different layers. This technology has shown tremendous potential in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. More recently, DL has also been successfully applied in drug discovery. Here, I analyze several relevant DL applications and case studies, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in drug discovery and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.

AB Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important research challenges and future directions are also highlighted.

AB Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain-machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.

AB Artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistant services have received notable scholarly attention. Fashion retailers offer AI-based voice assistants to facilitate online shoppers. However, the consumer motivations to use digital voice assistants and their effect on the purchase intentions of online fashion shoppers are unexplored. To bridge this literature gap, this study presents a unique theoretical model grounded in the consumer innovativeness concept, broaden-and-built theory, and stimulus-organism-response model to explore the effect of motivated consumer innovativeness to use digital voice assistants on purchase intention and awe experience of online shoppers. The study used data collected from 538 users of digital voice assistants for online shopping of fashion products. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that the functional, hedonic, social, and cognitive motivated consumer innovativeness for using voice assistants affects purchase intention and awe experience. Further, the awe experience mediates the relationship between motivated consumer innovativeness and purchase intention; and electronic word-of-mouth mediates the relationship between awe experience and purchase intention. The study theoretically contributes to the extant literature on consumer innovativeness, AI-based voice assistants, and fashion shopping. The findings offer insights to fashion retailers for improved use of voice as-sistants by online shoppers.

AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology is widely used in various fields. In the Earth observation system, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are acquired by hyperspectral sensors and always transmitted to the cloud for analysis. In order to reduce cost and reply promptly, we deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models for data analysis on edge servers. Subspace clustering, the core of the AI model, is employed to analyze high-dimensional image data such as HSIs. However, most traditional subspace clustering algorithms construct a single model, which can be affected by noise more easily. It hardly balances the sparsity and connectivity of the representation coefficient matrix. Therefore, we proposed a postprocess strategy of subspace clustering for taking account of sparsity and connectivity. First, we define close neighbors as having more common neighbors and higher coefficients neighbors, where the close neighbors are selected according to the nondominated sorting algorithm. Second, the coefficients between the sample and close neighbors are reserved, incorrect, or useless connections are pruned. Then, the postprocess strategy can reserve the intrasubspace connection and prune the intersubspace connection. In experiments, we verified the universality and effectiveness of postprocessing strategies in the traditional image recognition field and IoT field, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can process noise data in the IoT to improve clustering accuracy.

AB Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.

AB Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) is present in 3-6% of the general population, is associated with reduced quality of life and longevity, and is treatable when found(1-4). An inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool for ALVD in the doctor's office is not available. We tested the hypothesis that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine method of measuring the heart's electrical activity, could identify ALVD. Using paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of contractile function), from 44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with ventricular dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction <= 35%, using the ECG data alone. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the network model yielded values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93, 86.3%, 85.7%, and 85.7%, respectively. In patients without ventricular dysfunction, those with a positive AI screen were at 4 times the risk (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 5.0) of developing future ventricular dysfunction compared with those with a negative screen. Application of AI to the ECG-a ubiquitous, low-cost test-permits the ECG to serve as a powerful screening tool in asymptomatic individuals to identify ALVD.

AB PurposeWith the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, including healthcare, there is growing acceptance and interest in consulting AI models to provide medical information and advice. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses to practice quiz questions designed for otolaryngology board certification and decipher potential performance disparities across different otolaryngology subspecialties.MethodsA dataset covering 15 otolaryngology subspecialties was collected from an online learning platform funded by the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, designed for board certification examination preparation. These questions were entered into ChatGPT, with its responses being analyzed for accuracy and variance in performance.ResultsThe dataset included 2576 questions (479 multiple-choice and 2097 single-choice), of which 57% (n = 1475) were answered correctly by ChatGPT. An in-depth analysis of question style revealed that single-choice questions were associated with a significantly higher rate (p < 0.001) of correct responses (n = 1313; 63%) compared to multiple-choice questions (n = 162; 34%). Stratified by question categories, ChatGPT yielded the highest rate of correct responses (n = 151; 72%) in the field of allergology, whereas 7 out of 10 questions (n = 65; 71%) on legal otolaryngology aspects were answered incorrectly.ConclusionThe study reveals ChatGPT's potential as a supplementary tool for otolaryngology board certification preparation. However, its propensity for errors in certain otolaryngology areas calls for further refinement. Future research should address these limitations to improve ChatGPT's educational use. An approach, with expert collaboration, is recommended for the reliable and accurate integration of such AI models.

AB The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to selfexplain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.

AB Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT enables timely treatment of patients and helps control the spread of the disease. We proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) system for rapid COVID-19 detection and performed extensive statistical analysis of CTs of COVID-19 based on the AI system. We developed and evaluated our system on a large dataset with more than 10 thousand CT volumes from COVID-19, influenza-A/B, non-viral community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia subjects. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our deep convolutional neural network-based system is able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.81% for multi-way classification on test cohort of 3,199 scans, AUC of 92.99% and 93.25% on two publicly available datasets, CC-CCII and MosMedData respectively. In a reader study involving five radiologists, the AI system outperforms all of radiologists in more challenging tasks at a speed of two orders of magnitude above them. Diagnosis performance of chest x-ray (CXR) is compared to that of CT. Detailed interpretation of deep network is also performed to relate system outputs with CT presentations. The code is available at https://github.com/ChenWWWeixiang/diagnosis_covid19. In some contexts, rapid detection of COVID-19 from CT scans can be crucial for optimal patient management. Here, the authors present a Deep Learning system for this task with multi-center data, human reader comparison and age stratified results.

AB The skeleton is one of the most important organs in the human body in assisting our motion and activities; however, bone density attenuates gradually as we age. Among common bone diseases are osteoporosis and Paget's, two of the most frequently found diseases in the elderly. Nowadays, a combination of multiple drugs is the optimal therapy to decelerate osteoporosis and Paget's pathologic process, which comes with various underlying adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to evaluate the interaction, pharmacodynamics, and possible side effects between drugs. In this research, we created an AI-based machine-learning model to predict the outcomes of interactions between drugs used for osteoporosis and Paget's treatment, which helps mitigate the cost and time to implement the best combination of medications in clinical practice. In this study, a DDI dataset was collected from the DrugBank database within the osteoporosis and Paget diseases. We then extracted a variety of chemical features from the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) of defined drug pairs that interact with each other. Finally, machine-learning algorithms were implemented to learn the extracted features. Our stack ensemble model from Random Forest and XGBoost reached an average accuracy of 74 % in predicting DDIs. It was superior to individual models as well as previous methods in terms of most measurement metrics. This study showed the potential of AI models in predicting DDIs of Osteoporosis-Paget's disease in particular, and other diseases in general.

TI The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
AB In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be 'ethical', there is debate about both what constitutes 'ethical AI' and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies. As AI technology develops rapidly, it is widely recognized that ethical guidelines are required for safe and fair implementation in society. But is it possible to agree on what is 'ethical AI'? A detailed analysis of 84 AI ethics reports around the world, from national and international organizations, companies and institutes, explores this question, finding a convergence around core principles but substantial divergence on practical implementation.

AB The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a "new normal", the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.

LA English
DT Review
AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare services, faced with the twin challenges in acutely meeting the medical needs of patients with COVID-19 while continuing essential services for non-COVID-19 illnesses. The need to re-invent, re-organize and transform healthcare and co-ordinate clinical services at a population level is urgent as countries that controlled initial outbreaks start to experience resurgences. A wide range of digital health solutions have been proposed, although the extent of successful real-world applications of these technologies is unclear. This study aims to review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, and other relevant digital health solutions for public health responses in the healthcare operating environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic scoping review was performed to identify potentially relevant reports. Key findings include a large body of evidence for various clinical and operational applications of telehealth (40.1%, n=99/247). Although a large quantity of reports investigated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) (44.9%, n=111/247) and big data analytics (36.0%, n=89/247), weaknesses in study design limit generalizability and translation, highlighting the need for more pragmatic real-world investigations. There were also few descriptions of applications for the internet of things (IoT) (2.0%, n=5/247), digital platforms for communication (DC) (10.9%, 27/247), digital solutions for data management (DM) (1.6%, n=4/247), and digital structural screening (DS) (8.9%, n=22/247); representing gaps and opportunities for digital public health. Finally, the performance of digital health technology for operational applications related to population surveillance and points of entry have not been adequately evaluated.

AB New technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), virtual assistants, chatbots. and robots, which are typically powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), are dramatically transforming the customer experience. In this paper, we offer a fresh typology of new technologies powered by AI and propose a new framework for understanding the role of new technologies on the customer/shopper journey. Specifically, we discuss the impact and implications of these technologies on each broad stage of the shopping journey (pre-transaction, transaction, and post-transaction) and advance a new conceptualization for managing these new AI technologies along customer experience dimensions to create experiential value. We discuss future research ideas emanating from our framework and outline interdisciplinary research avenues. (C) 2020 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to deliver innovative business models across multiple domains by providing ubiquitous connectivity, intelligent data, predictive analytics, and decision-making systems for improved market performance. However, traditional IIoT architectures are highly susceptible to many security vulnerabilities and network intrusions, which bring challenges such as lack of privacy, integrity, trust, and centralization. This research aims to implement an Artificial Intelligence-based Lightweight Blockchain Security Model (AILBSM) to ensure privacy and security of IIoT systems. This novel model is meant to address issues that can occur with security and privacy when dealing with Cloud-based IIoT systems that handle data in the Cloud or on the Edge of Networks (on-device). The novel contribution of this paper is that it combines the advantages of both lightweight blockchain and Convivial Optimized Sprinter Neural Network (COSNN) based AI mechanisms with simplified and improved security operations. Here, the significant impact of attacks is reduced by transforming features into encoded data using an Authentic Intrinsic Analysis (AIA) model. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate this system using various attack datasets. In addition, the results of privacy protection and AI mechanisms are evaluated separately and compared using various indicators. By using the proposed AILBSM framework, the execution time is minimized to 0.6 seconds, the overall classification accuracy is improved to 99.8%, and detection performance is increased to 99.7%. Due to the inclusion of auto-encoder based transformation and blockchain authentication, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed model is highly improved, when compared to other techniques.

AB The emergence of the Industry 4.0 revolution to upgrade the Internet of Things (IoT) standards provides the prominence outcomes for the future wireless communication systems called 5G. The development of 5G green communication systems suffers from the various challenges to fulfill the requirement of higher user capacity, network speed, minimum cost, and reduced resource consumption. The use of 5G standards for Industry 4.0 applications will increase data rate performance and connected device's reliability. Since the arrival of novel Covid-19 disease, there is a higher demand for smart healthcare systems worldwide. However, designing the 5G communication systems has the research challenges like optimum resource utilization, mobility management, cost-efficiency, interference management, spectral efficiency, etc. The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across the different formats brings performance enhancement compared to conventional techniques. Therefore, introducing the AI into 5G standards will optimize the performances further considering the various end-user applications. We first present the survey of the terms like 5G standard, Industry 4.0, and some recent works for future wireless communications. The purpose is to explore the current research problems using the 5G technology. We further propose the novel architecture for smart healthcare systems using the 5G and Industry 4.0 standards. We design and implement that proposed model using the Network Simulator (NS2) to investigate the current 5G methods. The simulation results show that current 5G methods for resource management and interference management suffer from the challenges like performance trade-offs.

AB The virus SARS-CoV2, which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic and has spread to every inhabited continent. Given the increasing caseload, there is an urgent need to augment clinical skills in order to identify from among the many mild cases the few that will progress to critical illness. We present a first step towards building an artificial intelligence (AI) framework, with predictive analytics (PA) capabilities applied to real patient data, to provide rapid clinical decision-making support. COVID-19 has presented a pressing need as a) clinicians are still developing clinical acumen to this novel disease and b) resource limitations in a surging pandemic require difficult resource allocation decisions. The objectives of this research are: (1) to algorithmically identify the combinations of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict outcomes, and (2) to develop a tool with AI capabilities that will predict patients at risk for more severe illness on initial presentation. The predictive models learn from historical data to help predict who will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe outcome in COVID-19. Our results, based on data from two hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, identified features on initial presentation with COVID-19 that were most predictive of later development of ARDS. A mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (a liver enzyme), the presence of myalgias (body aches), and an elevated hemoglobin (red blood cells), in this order, are the clinical features, on presentation, that are the most predictive. The predictive models that learned from historical data of patients from these two hospitals achieved 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting severe cases.

AB At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning, internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin. Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain, aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.

ID CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY
AB The rapid increase in telemedicine coupled with recent advances in diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) create the imperative to consider the opportunities and risks of inserting AI-based support into new paradigms of care. Here we build on recent achievements in the accuracy of image-based AI for skin cancer diagnosis to address the effects of varied representations of AI-based support across different levels of clinical expertise and multiple clinical workflows. We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis. Together, our approach and findings offer a framework for future studies across the spectrum of image-based diagnostics to improve human-computer collaboration in clinical practice.
   A systematic evaluation of the value of AI-based decision support in skin tumor diagnosis demonstrates the superiority of human-computer collaboration over each individual approach and supports the potential of automated approaches in diagnostic medicine.

AB The social companionship (SC) feature in conversational agents (CAs) enables the emotional bond and consumer relationships. The heightened interest in SC with CAs led to exponential growth in publications scattered across disciplines with fragmented findings, thus limiting holistic understanding of the domain and warrants a macroscopic view of the domain to guide future research directions. The present study fills the research void by offering a comprehensive literature review entailing science performance and intellectual structure mapping. The comprehensive review revealed the research domain's major theories, constructs, and thematic structure. The-matic and content analysis of intellectual structure resulted in a conceptual framework encompassing anteced-ents, mediators, moderators, and consequences of SC with CAs. The study discusses future research directions guiding practitioners and academicians in designing efficient and ethical AI companions.

AB Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making processes are increasingly criticized for their black-box nature. Explainable AI approaches to trace human-interpretable decision processes from algorithms have been explored. Yet, little is known about algorithmic explainability from a human factors' perspective. From the perspective of user interpretability and understandability, this study examines the effect of explainability in AI on user trust and attitudes toward AI. It conceptualizes causability as an antecedent of explainability and as a key cue of an algorithm and examines them in relation to trust by testing how they affect user perceived performance of AI-driven services. The results show the dual roles of causability and explainability in terms of its underlying links to trust and subsequent user behaviors. Explanations of why certain news articles are recommended generate users trust whereas causability of to what extent they can understand the explanations affords users emotional confidence. Causability lends the justification for what and how should be explained as it determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability. The results have implications for the inclusion of causability and explanatory cues in AI systems, which help to increase trust and help users to assess the quality of explanations. Causable explainable AI will help people understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms by bringing transparency and accountability into AI systems.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships that influence the value co-creation process and lead to consumer comfort with artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile banking (AIMB) service platforms.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model was developed to investigate the value-in-use perceptions of AI-based mobile banking applications via five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. Data were collected from 218 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling.
   Findings - This study highlights the role and importance of the sequential relationships that impact the assessment of AIMB. The findings suggest that service delivery and the customer's role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. Furthermore, AIMB offers transaction-oriented (utilitarian) value propositions more so than relationship-oriented (hedonic) value propositions.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample consisted on digital natives. Additional age cohorts are needed.
   Practical implications - As financial institutions redirect their business models toward digital self-service technology channels, the need for customers to feel comfortable while interacting with an AI agent will be critical for enhancing the customer experience and firm performance.
   Originality/value - The authors extend the service-dominant logic (SDL) literature by showing that value co-creation is a function of both firms' technologies and consumers' value-in-use, a finding that appears to be unique in the literature. The authors advance the digital transformation literature by evaluating AIMB as an interactive process that requires an understanding of key technology constructs, including perceptions of baseline service relationships, desired service configurations, security and safety issues and whether AI is useful for value co-creation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first SDL framework that investigates interactive and structural relationships to explain value-in-use perceptions of AIMB.

AB Recently, edge artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., federated edge learning) are emerged to unleash the potential of big data from Internet of Things (IoT). By learning knowledge on local devices, data privacy preserving and Quality of Service (QoS) are guaranteed. Nevertheless, the dilemma between the limited on-device battery capacities and the high energy demands in learning is not resolved. When the on-device battery is exhausted, the edge learning process will have to be interrupted. In this article, we propose a novel wirelessly powered edge intelligence (WPEG) framework, which aims to achieve a stable, robust, and sustainable edge intelligence by energy harvesting (EH) methods. First, we build a permissioned edge blockchain to secure the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy and knowledge sharing in our framework. To maximize edge intelligence efficiency, we then investigate the wirelessly powered multiagent edge learning model and design the optimal edge learning strategy. Moreover, by constructing a two-stage Stackelberg game, the underlying energy-knowledge trading incentive mechanisms are also proposed with the optimal economic incentives and power transmission strategies. Finally, simulation results show that our incentive strategies could optimize the utilities of both parties compared with classic schemes, and our optimal learning design could realize the optimal learning efficiency.

AB Our title alludes to the three Christmas ghosts encountered by Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, who guide Ebenezer through the past, present, and future of Christmas holiday events. Similarly, our article takes readers through a journey of the past, present, and future of medical AI. In doing so, we focus on the crux of modern machine learning: the reliance on powerful but intrinsically opaque models. When applied to the healthcare domain, these models fail to meet the needs for transparency that their clinician and patient end-users require. We review the implications of this failure, and argue that opaque models (1) lack quality assurance, (2) fail to elicit trust, and (3) restrict physician-patient dialogue. We then discuss how upholding transparency in all aspects of model design and model validation can help ensure the reliability and success of medical AI.

AB Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport. Their intricate 120-megadalton architecture remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a 70-megadalton model of the human NPC scaffold with explicit membrane and in multiple conformational states. We combined artificial intelligence (AI)-based structure prediction with in situ and in cellulo cryo-electron tomography and integrative modeling. We show that linker nucleoporins spatially organize the scaffold within and across subcomplexes to establish the higher-order structure. Microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the scaffold is not required to stabilize the inner and outer nuclear membrane fusion but rather widens the central pore. Our work exemplifies how AI-based modeling can be integrated with in situ structural biology to understand subcellular architecture across spatial organization levels.

AB The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in business has proliferated in recent years. Businesses have started adopting various technology practices relevant to automation and AI, and research investigating this phenomenon is becoming increasingly important. Taking this as a cue, the present research investigates the effect of human-to-machine interaction and human-to-human interaction towards cognitive absorption and its subsequent effect on trust, experience, and continuation intention in the context of services. The study built a 3 x 3 factorial design with automated chatbots (machine interaction) and service executives (human interaction) used as a stimulus in the experiment. Data collected from 410 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicated that human-to-machine interaction influences cognitive absorption more positively compared to human-to-human interactions. The study results also provide evidence for the role of the trust, experience, and technology continuation intention in a technology background rooted in human-machine interactions. The present study adds a valuable contribution to the existing literature relevant to human-to-machine interaction, cognitive absorption, trust, experience, and continuation intention. The study also provides valuable inputs to technology and marketing managers.

AB PurposeThis work consists of a critical reflection on the extent to which hospitality and tourism management scholars have accurately used the term "analytics" and its five types (i.e. descriptive, exploratory, predictive, prescriptive and cognitive analytics) in their research. Only cognitive analytics, the latest and most advanced type, is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and requires machine learning (ML). As cognitive analytics constitutes the cutting edge in industry application, this study aims to examine in depth the extent cognitive analytics has been covered in the literature. Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) of the hospitality and tourism literature on the topic of "analytics". The SLR findings were complemented by the results of an additional search query based on "machine learning" and "deep learning" that was used as a robustness check. Moreover, the SLR findings were triangulated with recent literature reviews on related topics (e.g. big data and AI) to generate additional insights. FindingsThe findings of this study show that: there is a growing and accelerating body of research on analytics; the literature lacks a consistent use of terminology and definitions related to analytics. Specifically, publications rarely use scientific definitions of analytics and their different types; although AI and ML are key enabling technologies for cognitive analytics, hospitality and tourism management research did not explicitly link these terms to analytics and did not distinguish cognitive analytics from other forms of analytics that do not rely on ML. In fact, the term "cognitive analytics" is apparently missing in the hospitality and tourism management literature. Research limitations/implicationsThis study generates a set of eight theoretical and three practical implications and advance theoretical and methodological recommendations for further research. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explicitly and critically examines the use of analytics in general, and cognitive analytics in particular, in the hospitality and tourism management literature.

AB Recently, along with the rapid development of mobile communication technology, edge computing theory and techniques have been attracting more and more attention from global researchers and engineers, which can significantly bridge the capacity of cloud and requirement of devices by the network edges, and thus can accelerate content delivery and improve the quality of mobile services. In order to bring more intelligence to edge systems, compared to traditional optimization methodology, and driven by the current deep learning techniques, we propose to integrate the Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques and Federated Learning framework with mobile edge systems, for optimizing mobile edge computing, caching and communication. And thus, we design the "In-Edge AI" framework in order to intelligently utilize the collaboration among devices and edge nodes to exchange the learning parameters for a better training and inference of the models, and thus to carry out dynamic system-level optimization and application-level enhancement while reducing the unnecessary system communication load. "In-Edge AI" is evaluated and proved to have near-optimal performance but relatively low overhead of learning, while the system is cognitive and adaptive to mobile communication systems. Finally, we discuss several related challenges and opportunities for unveiling a promising upcoming future of "In-Edge AI."

AB Traditional plant breeding evaluation methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Accurate and rapid phenotypic trait data acquisition and analysis can improve genomic selection and accelerate cultivar development. In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively. This UAV-based technique provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective, and rapid method to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus varieties and rootstocks.

AB Settlement prediction of geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) abutments under service loading conditions is an arduous and challenging task for practicing geotechnical/civil engineers. Hence, in this paper, a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based model was developed by the combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and Harris hawks' optimisation (HHO), that is, ANN-HHO, to predict the settlement of the GRS abutments. Five other robust intelligent models such as support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), relevance vector machine (RVM), sequential minimal optimisation regression (SMOR), and least-median square regression (LMSR) were constructed and compared to the ANN-HHO model. The predictive strength, relalibility and robustness of the model were evaluated based on rigorous statistical testing, ranking criteria, multi-criteria approach, uncertainity analysis and sensitivity analysis (SA). Moreover, the predictive veracity of the model was also substantiated against several large-scale independent experimental studies on GRS abutments reported in the scientific literature. The acquired findings demonstrated that the ANN-HHO model predicted the settlement of GRS abutments with reasonable accuracy and yielded superior performance in comparison to counterpart models. Therefore, it becomes one of predictive tools employed by geotechnical/civil engineers in preliminary decision-making when investigating the in-service performance of GRS abutments. Finally, the model has been converted into a simple mathematical formulation for easy hand calculations, and it is proved cost-effective and less time-consuming in comparison to experimental tests and numerical simulations.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received widespread attention due to their powerful modeling capabilities and have been successfully applied in natural language processing, image recognition, and other fields. On the other hand, traditional CNN can only deal with Euclidean spatial data. In contrast, many real-life scenarios, such as transportation networks, social networks, reference networks, and so on, exist in graph data. The creation of graph convolution operators and graph pooling is at the heart of migrating CNN to graph data analysis and processing. With the advancement of the Internet and technology, graph convolution network (GCN), as an innovative technology in artificial intelligence (AI), has received more and more attention. GCN has been widely used in different fields such as image processing, intelligent recommender system, knowledge-based graph, and other areas due to their excellent characteristics in processing non-European spatial data. At the same time, communication networks have also embraced AI technology in recent years, and AI serves as the brain of the future network and realizes the comprehensive intelligence of the future grid. Many complex communication network problems can be abstracted as graph-based optimization problems and solved by GCN, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. This survey briefly describes the definition of graph-based machine learning, introduces different types of graph networks, summarizes the application of GCN in various research fields, analyzes the research status, and gives the future research direction.

TI AI for radiographic COVID-19 detection selects shortcuts over signal
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEEP; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious 'shortcuts'. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired 'shortcuts' learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models.
   The urgency of the developing COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of novel diagnostic approaches, many of which use machine learning. DeGrave and colleagues use explainable AI techniques to analyse a selection of these approaches and find that the methods frequently learn to identify features unrelated to the actual disease.

AB Background: Multiple studies have compared the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) -based models for automated skin cancer classification to human experts, thus setting the cornerstone for a successful translation of AI-based tools into clinicopathological practice. Objective: The objective of the study was to systematically analyse the current state of research on reader studies involving melanoma and to assess their potential clinical relevance by evaluating three main aspects: test set characteristics (holdout/out-of-distribution data set, composition), test setting (experimental/clinical, inclusion of metadata) and representativeness of participating clini-cians. Methods: PubMed, Medline and ScienceDirect were screened for peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2021 and dealing with AI-based skin cancer classification involving melanoma. The search terms skin cancer classification, deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), melanoma (detection), digital biomarkers, histopathology and whole slide imaging were com-bined. Based on the search results, only studies that considered direct comparison of AI results with clinicians and had a diagnostic classification as their main objective were included. Results: A total of 19 reader studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 CNN-based ap-proaches addressed the classification of dermoscopic images; 6 concentrated on the classification of clinical images, whereas 2 dermatopathological studies utilised digitised histopathological whole slide images. Conclusions: All 19 included studies demonstrated superior or at least equivalent performance of CNN-based classifiers compared with clinicians. However, almost all studies were conducted in highly artificial settings based exclusively on single images of the suspicious lesions. Moreover, test sets mainly consisted of holdout images and did not represent the full range of patient populations and melanoma subtypes encountered in clinical practice. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB From AlphaGo to ChatGPT, the field of AI has launched a series of remarkable achievements in recent years. Analyzing, comparing, and summarizing these achievements at the paradigm level is important for future AI innovation, but has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we give an overview and perspective on machine learning paradigms. First, we propose a paradigm taxonomy with three levels and seven dimensions from a knowledge perspective. Accordingly, we give an overview on three basic and twelve extended learning paradigms, such as Ensemble Learning, Transfer Learning, etc., with figures in unified style. We further analyze three advanced paradigms, i.e., AlphaGo, AlphaFold and ChatGPT. Second, to enable more efficient and effective scientific discovery, we propose to build a new ecosystem that drives AI paradigm shifts through the decentralized science (DeSci) movement based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). To this end, we design the Hanoi framework, which integrates human factors, parallel intelligence based on a combination of artificial systems and the natural world, and the DAO to inspire AI innovations.

AB Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving AI technique where clients (i.e., organizations or devices) train models locally and formulate a global model based on the local model updates without transferring local data externally. However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multistakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a COVID-19 X-ray detection use case. The evaluation results show that the approach is feasible to enable accountability and improve fairness. The proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the default federated learning setting in terms of the model's generalization and accuracy.

TI Innovation and Design in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RADICAL INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; CREATIVITY; MOTIVATION; FRAMEWORK
AB At the heart of any innovation process lies a fundamental practice: the way people create ideas and solve problems. This "decision making" side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as "design." Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture?
   This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking.
   Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI-Netflix and Airbnb (complemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)-which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and enhancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle.
   In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead handle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously. This paper discusses the implications of these insights for design and innovation management scholars and practitioners.

AB Objective: The aimof this study was to evaluate the image quality (IQ) and performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system in photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) for pulmonary nodule evaluation at different low-dose levels. Materials and Methods: An anthropomorphic chest-phantom containing 14 pulmonary nodules of different sizes (range, 3-12 mm) was imaged on a PCD-CT and on a conventional energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT). Scans were performed with each of the 3 vendor-specific scanning modes (QuantumPlus [Q+], Quantum [Q], and High Resolution [HR]) at decreasing matched radiation dose levels (volume computed tomography dose index ranging from 1.79 to 0.31 mGy) by adapting IQ levels from 30 to 5. Image noisewas measured manually in the chest wall at 8 different locations. Subjective IQ was evaluated by 2 readers in consensus. Nodule detection and volumetry were performed using a commercially available AI-CAD system. Results: Subjective IQwas superior in PCD-CT compared with EID-CT (P< 0.001), and objective image noisewas similar in the Q+ and Q-mode (P > 0.05) and superior in the HR-mode (PCD 55.8 +/- 11.7 HU vs EID 74.8 +/- 5.4 HU; P = 0.01). High resolution showed the lowest image noise values among PCDmodes (P = 0.01). Overall, the AI-CAD system delivered comparable results for lung nodule detection and volumetry between PCD- and dose-matched EID-CT (P = 0.08-1.00), with a mean sensitivity of 95% for PCD-CT and of 86% for dose-matched EID-CT in the lowest evaluated dose level (IQ5). Q+ and Q-mode showed higher false-positive rates than EID-CT at lower-dose levels (IQ10 and IQ5). The HR-mode showed a sensitivity of 100% with a false-positive rate of 1 even at the lowest evaluated dose level (IQ5; CDTIvol, 0.41 mGy). Conclusions: Photon-counting detector CT was superior to dose-matched EID-CT in subjective IQ while showing comparable to lower objective image noise. Fully automatized AI-aided nodule detection and volumetry are feasible in PCD-CT, but attention has to be paid to false-positive findings.

AB Purpose This study aims to investigate the customers' behavioral intention and actual usage (AUE) of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots for hospitality and tourism in India by extending the technology adoption model (TAM) with context-specific variables. Design/methodology/approach To understand the customers' behavioral intention and AUE of AI-powered chatbots for tourism, the mixed-method design was used whereby qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. A total of 36 senior managers and executives from the travel agencies were interviewed and the analysis of interview data was done using NVivo 8.0 software. A total of 1,480 customers were surveyed and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Findings As per the results, the predictors of chatbot adoption intention (AIN) are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived trust (PTR), perceived intelligence (PNT) and anthropomorphism (ANM). Technological anxiety (TXN) does not influence the chatbot AIN. Stickiness to traditional human travel agents negatively moderates the relation of AIN and AUE of chatbots in tourism and provides deeper insights into manager's commitment to providing travel planning services using AI-based chatbots. Practical implications This research presents unique practical insights to the practitioners, managers and executives in the tourism industry, system designers and developers of AI-based chatbot technologies to understand the antecedents of chatbot adoption by travelers. TXN is a vital concern for the customers; so, designers and developers should ensure that chatbots are easily accessible, have a user-friendly interface, be more human-like and communicate in various native languages with the customers. Originality/value This study contributes theoretically by extending the TAM to provide better explanatory power with human-robot interaction context-specific constructs - PTR, PNT, ANM and TXN - to examine the customers' chatbot AIN. This is the first step in the direction to empirically test and validate a theoretical model for chatbots' adoption and usage, which is a disruptive technology in the hospitality and tourism sector in an emerging economy such as India.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed for echocardiography(1-3), although it has not yet been tested with blinding and randomization. Here we designed a blinded, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05140642; no outside funding) of AI versus sonographer initial assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to evaluate the impact of AI in the interpretation workflow. The primary end point was the change in the LVEF between initial AI or sonographer assessment and final cardiologist assessment, evaluated by the proportion of studies with substantial change (more than 5% change). From 3,769 echocardiographic studies screened, 274 studies were excluded owing to poor image quality. The proportion of studies substantially changed was 16.8% in the AI group and 27.2% in the sonographer group (difference of -10.4%, 95% confidence interval: -13.2% to -7.7%, P < 0.001 for non-inferiority, P < 0.001 for superiority). The mean absolute difference between final cardiologist assessment and independent previous cardiologist assessment was 6.29% in the AI group and 7.23% in the sonographer group (difference of -0.96%, 95% confidence interval: -1.34% to -0.54%, P < 0.001 for superiority). The AI-guided workflow saved time for both sonographers and cardiologists, and cardiologists were not able to distinguish between the initial assessments by AI versus the sonographer (blinding index of 0.088). For patients undergoing echocardiographic quantification of cardiac function, initial assessment of LVEF by AI was non-inferior to assessment by sonographers.

AB Technologies that accelerate the delivery of reliable battery-based energy storage will not only contribute to decarbonization such as transportation electrification, smart grid, but also strengthen the battery supply chain. As battery inevitably ages with time, losing its capacity to store charge and deliver it efficiently. This directly affects battery safety and efficiency, making related health management necessary. Recent advancements in automation science and engineering raised interest in AI-based solutions to prolong battery lifetime from both manufacturing and management perspectives. This paper aims at presenting a critical review of the state-of-the-art AI-based manufacturing and management strategies towards long lifetime battery. First, AI-based battery manufacturing and smart battery to benefit battery health are showcased. Then the most adopted AI solutions for battery life diagnostic including state-of-health estimation and ageing prediction are reviewed with a discussion of their advantages and drawbacks. Efforts through designing suitable AI solutions to enhance battery longevity are also presented. Finally, the main challenges involved and potential strategies in this field are suggested. This work will inform insights into the feasible, advanced AI for the health-conscious manufacturing, control and optimization of battery on different technology readiness levels.

   natural language processing; nursing
AB Background:ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-driven, pretrained, deep learning language model, can generate natural language text in response to a given query. Its rapid growth has led to concerns about ethical use in academia. Problem:The exponential rise in the popularity of ChatGPT, and concerns of academic integrity with its use, has raised concerns among faculty for how to best address this issue. Approach:Faculty should understand the potential benefits and limitations of ChatGPT and create assignments that emphasize self-reflection, critical thinking, problem solving, and independent learning. Students must be taught how to critically evaluate information and how to make informed decisions. Conclusions:ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize nursing education. However, it is critical for faculty to be familiar with its capabilities and limitations in order to foster effective, yet ethical and responsible utilization, while preparing students for the dynamic, rapidly advancing technological landscape in nursing and health care.

AB A new artificial intelligence (AI) model, called Bagging-LMT - a combination of bagging ensemble and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) - is introduced for mapping flood susceptibility. A spatial database was generated for the Haraz watershed, northern Iran, that included a flood inventory map and eleven flood conditioning factors based on the Information Gain Ratio (IGR). The model was evaluated using precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Kappa and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve criteria. The model was also compared with four state-of-the-art benchmark soft computing models, including LMT, logistic regression, Bayesian logistic regression, and random forest. Results revealed that the proposed model outperformed all these models and indicate that the proposed model can be used for sustainable management of flood-prone areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sensing technology has long been an integral part of modern developments that have brought several benefits to various domains ranging from civil and military to commercial and healthcare applications. However, the sensor's inadequate energy is the primary concern that affects their long-term sustainable operations and remote location deployment. Therefore, self-powered sensors with the ability to scavenge energy from the environment to self-drive the sensor's operation have received significant attention in recent years. Self-powered sensors with energy harvesting technology can convert the ambient energy available in the environment, such as mechanical, thermal, wave, and solar energy, into electric energy to self-power the sensors for long-term sustainable operations. Self-powered sensors have been a vital part of technological advances since the 21st century, and the existing literature has thoroughly studied the fabrication material of self-powered sensors and their energy harvesting mechanisms. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art design solutions for self-powered sensors and their implementation challenges. To address the limitations of past and current reviews, we have reviewed state-of-the-art architectures of self-powered sensors and their applications in various domains (such as civil, automotive systems, environmental, robotic, human-machine interactions, healthcare, and fitness applications). Moreover, following the study of existing designs of self-powered sensors, we provide a general architecture for a self-powered sensor design, and we discuss the implementation challenges of self-powered sensors that affect their long-term operations. These challenges include energy, size, cost, robustness, stability, and artificial intelligence (AI). We also discuss possible solutions to address the implementation challenges that we have identified to enable the design of cost-effective self-powered sensor-based monitoring systems for diverse applications.

AB An ideal anti-counterfeiting technique has to be inexpensive, mass-producible, non-destructive, unclonable and convenient for authentication. Although many anti-counterfeiting technologies have been developed, very few of them fulfill all the above requirements. Here we report a non-destructive, inkjet-printable, artificial intelligence (AI)-decodable and unclonable security label. The stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact line of the ink droplets is crucial for the successful inkjet printing of the unclonable security labels. Upon the solvent evaporation, the three-phase contact lines are pinned around the pinning points, where the quantum dots in the ink droplets deposited on, forming physically unclonable flower-like patterns. By utilizing the RGB emission quantum dots, full-color fluorescence security labels can be produced. A convenient and reliable Al-based authentication strategy is developed, allowing for the fast authentication of the covert, unclonable flower-like dot patterns with different sharpness, brightness, rotations, amplifications and the mixture of these parameters.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-the ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks to achieve a particular goal based on provided data-is revolutionizing and reshaping our health-care systems. The current availability of ever-increasing computational power, highly developed pattern recognition algorithms and advanced image processing software working at very high speeds has led to the emergence of computer-based systems that are trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. Accessibility to 'big data' enables the 'cognitive' computer to scan billions of bits of unstructured information, extract the relevant information and recognize complex patterns with increasing confidence. Computer-based decision-support systems based on machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by performing complex tasks that are currently assigned to specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. These characteristics could be especially helpful in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics. Medicine must adapt to this changing world, and urologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, as high-volume users of imaging and pathology, need to understand this burgeoning science and acknowledge that the development of highly accurate AI-based decision-support applications of ML will require collaboration between data scientists, computer researchers and engineers.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating the development of unconventional computing paradigms inspired by the abilities and energy efficiency of the brain. The human brain excels especially in computationally intensive cognitive tasks, such as pattern recognition and classification. A long-term goal is de-centralized neuromorphic computing, relying on a network of distributed cores to mimic the massive parallelism of the brain, thus rigorously following a nature-inspired approach for information processing. Through the gradual transformation of interconnected computing blocks into continuous computing tissue, the development of advanced forms of matter exhibiting basic features of intelligence can be envisioned, able to learn and process information in a delocalized manner. Such intelligent matter would interact with the environment by receiving and responding to external stimuli, while internally adapting its structure to enable the distribution and storage (as memory) of information. We review progress towards implementations of intelligent matter using molecular systems, soft materials or solid-state materials, with respect to applications in soft robotics, the development of adaptive artificial skins and distributed neuromorphic computing.

AB Smart grids are the developmental trend of power systems and they have attracted much attention all over the world. Due to their complexities, and the uncertainty of the smart grid and high volume of information being collected, artificial intelligence techniques represent some of the enabling technologies for its future development and success. Owing to the decreasing cost of computing power, the profusion of data, and better algorithms, AI has entered into its new developmental stage and AI 2.0 is developing rapidly. Deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL) and their combination-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are representative methods and relatively mature methods in the family of AI 2.0. This article introduces the concept and status quo of the above three methods, summarizes their potential for application in smart grids, and provides an overview of the research work on their application in smart grids.

AB Hyperspectral (HS) imaging, also known as image spectrometry, is a landmark technique in geoscience and remote sensing (RS). In the past decade, enormous efforts have been made to process and analyze these HS products, mainly by seasoned experts. However, with an ever-growing volume of data, the bulk of costs in manpower and material resources poses new challenges for reducing the burden of manual labor and improving efficiency. For this reason, it is urgent that more intelligent and automatic approaches for various HS RS applications be developed. Machine learning (ML) tools with convex optimization have successfully undertaken the tasks of numerous artificial intelligence (AI)-related applications; however, their ability to handle complex practical problems remains limited, particularly for HS data, due to the effects of various spectral variabilities in the process of HS imaging and the complexity and redundancy of higher-dimensional HS signals. Compared to convex models, nonconvex modeling, which is capable of characterizing more complex real scenes and providing model interpretability technically and theoretically, has proven to be a feasible solution that reduces the gap between challenging HS vision tasks and currently advanced intelligent data processing models.

TI Artificial Intelligence-Powered Spatial Analysis of Tumor-Infiltrating
   Lymphocytes as Complementary Biomarker for Immune Checkpoint Inhibition
   in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

DT Article
ID PEMBROLIZUMAB; EXCLUSION
AB PURPOSE Biomarkers on the basis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are potentially valuable in predicting the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, clinical application remains challenging because of methodologic limitations and laborious process involved in spatial analysis of TIL distribution in whole-slide images (WSI). METHODS We have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered WSI analyzer of TIL in the tumor microenvironment that can define three immune phenotypes (IPs): inflamed, immune-excluded, and immune-desert. These IPs were correlated with tumor response to ICI and survival in two independent cohorts of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS Inflamed IP correlated with enrichment in local immune cytolytic activity, higher response rate, and prolonged progression-free survival compared with patients with immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotypes. At the WSI level, there was significant positive correlation between tumor proportion score (TPS) as determined by the AI model and control TPS analyzed by pathologists (P < .001). Overall, 44.0% of tumors were inflamed, 37.1% were immune-excluded, and 18.9% were immune-desert. Incidence of inflamed IP in patients with programmed death ligand-1 TPS at < 1%, 1%-49%, and >= 50% was 31.7%, 42.5%, and 56.8%, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were, respectively, 4.1 months and 24.8 months with inflamed IP, 2.2 months and 14.0 months with immune-excluded IP, and 2.4 months and 10.6 months with immune-desert IP. CONCLUSION The AI-powered spatial analysis of TIL correlated with tumor response and progression-free survival of ICI in advanced NSCLC. This is potentially a supplementary biomarker to TPS as determined by a pathologist.

AB While there has been a significant interest in understanding the cyber threat landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and the design of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security approaches, there is a lack of distributed architecture led to generating heterogeneous datasets that contain the actual behaviors of real-world IoT networks and complex cyber threat scenarios to evaluate the credibility of the new systems. This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, realworld normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named 'TON_IoT', as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing. A comparative summary of the TON_IoT network dataset and other competing network datasets demonstrates its diverse legitimate and anomalous patterns that can be used to better validate new AIbased security solutions. The architecture and datasets can be publicly accessed from TON_IOT Datasets (2020).

AB Histological remission is evolving as an important treatment target in UC. We aimed to develop a simple histological index, aligned to endoscopy, correlated with clinical outcomes, and suited to apply to an artificial intelligence (AI) system to evaluate inflammatory activity. Methods Using a set of 614 biopsies from 307 patients with UC enrolled into a prospective multicentre study, we developed the Paddington International virtual ChromoendoScopy ScOre (PICaSSO) Histologic Remission Index (PHRI). Agreement with multiple other histological indices and validation for inter-reader reproducibility were assessed. Finally, to implement PHRI into a computer-aided diagnosis system, we trained and tested a novel deep learning strategy based on a CNN architecture to detect neutrophils, calculate PHRI and identify active from quiescent UC using a subset of 138 biopsies. Results PHRI is strongly correlated with endoscopic scores (Mayo Endoscopic Score and UC Endoscopic Index of Severity and PICaSSO) and with clinical outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and initiation or changes in medical therapy due to UC flare-up). A PHRI score of 1 could accurately stratify patients' risk of adverse outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and treatment optimisation due to flare-up) within 12 months. Our inter-reader agreement was high (intraclass correlation 0.84). Our preliminary AI algorithm differentiated active from quiescent UC with 78% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity and 86% accuracy. Conclusions PHRI is a simple histological index in UC, and it exhibits the highest correlation with endoscopic activity and clinical outcomes. A PHRI-based AI system was accurate in predicting histological remission.

AB Traditional electronic skin (e-skin), due to the lack of human-brain-like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)-motivated full-skin bionic (FSB) e-skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis-dermis-hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e-skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa(-1) (<1 kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa(-1) (1-34 kPa), and fast response/recovery time of <5.6 ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a "brain". First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis-dermis-hypodermis and a five-layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e-skin with a six-layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real-time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

   Classification
AB Background and objectives: Chest X-ray data have been found to be very promising for assessing COVID-19 patients, especially for resolving emergency-department and urgent-care-center overcapacity. Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the disease using chest X-rays. Given many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, the objective of this study is to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. If fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs can provide equivalent or better classification results than other more sophisticated CNNs, then the deployment of AI-based tools for detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray data can be more rapid and cost-effective.
   Methods: Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases.
   Results: In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the receiver-operatingcharacteristic curve.
   Conclusion: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.

AB Recent improvements in the Internet of Things (IoT) have allowed healthcare to evolve rapidly. This article summarizes previous studies on IoT applications in healthcare. A comprehensive review and a bibliometric analysis were performed to objectively summarize the growth of IoT research in healthcare. To begin, 2,990 journal articles were carefully selected for further investigation. These publications were analyzed based on various bibliometric metrics, including publication year, journals, authors, institutions, and countries. Keyword co-occurrence and co -citation networks were generated to unravel significant research hotspots. The findings show that IoT research has received considerable interest from the healthcare community. Based on the results of the keyword co-occurrence network, IoT healthcare applications, blockchain applica-tions, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, 5G telecommunications, as well as data analytics and computing technologies emerged as important topics. The co-citation network analysis reveals other important themes, including authentication schemes, fog computing, cloud-IoT integration, and cognitive smart healthcare. Overall, the review offers scholars an improved understanding of the current status of IoT research in healthcare and identifies knowledge gaps for future research. This review also informs healthcare professionals about the latest developments and applications of IoT in the healthcare sector.

AB Artificially Intelligent (AI) voice assistants (VAs) are continuing to grow in popularity amongst consumers. While in their infancy, several brands are now utilising VAs such as the Amazon Echo to deliver brand-related information and services. However, despite the increasing use of VAs, we have little understanding of what motivates consumers to use such devices for brand-related information. Focusing on the Amazon Echo in-home VA, and its associated Alexa Skills, this research uncovers the key drivers of consumer brand engagement through VAs. In study 1, through a set of in-depth exploratory interviews with 21 respondents, we established three factors as key drivers of why consumers use VAs to engage with brands: AI attributes, technology attributes, and situational attributes. Study 2 examines these specific drivers via a questionnaire with 724 respondents. The findings outline the VA as an actor in the engagement process and affirm the importance of the VA's AI attributes of social presence, perceived intelligence, and social attraction in influencing consumer brand engagement. Additionally, technology attributes influence consumer brand engagement, along with the utilitarian benefits derived from interactions with brand-related information. Hedonic benefits do not influence consumer brand engagement via VA technology, while trust concerns play a negative role in brand engagement behaviour. Lastly, the results convey that consumer brand engagement via a VA influences brand usage intention, but in contrast to previous research, does not directly influence future purchase intention.

AB Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks such as scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such human-AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to the difficulties that AI systems face in navigating complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop HAILEY, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate HAILEY in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N = 300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.6% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger, 38.9% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyse the human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social and high-stakes tasks such as empathic conversations.
   AI language modelling and generation approaches have developed fast in the last decade, opening promising new directions in human-AI collaboration. An AI-in-the loop conversational system called HAILEY is developed to empower peer supporters in providing empathic responses to mental health support seekers.

TI Artificial Intelligence Augmentation of Radiologist Performance in
   Distinguishing COVID-19 from Pneumonia of Other Origin at Chest CT
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pneumonia of other diseases share similar CT characteristics, which contributes to the challenges in differentiating them with high accuracy.
   Purpose: To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the Efficient Net B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance.
   Results: The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, Delta= 5, P<.001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, Delta = 9, P<.001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, Delta= 3, P =.001).
   Conclusion: Artificial intelligence assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumoniafrom non-coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia at chest CT. (C) RSNA, 2020

AB The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prevails as an ultimatum to the global economic growth and henceforth, all of society since neither a curing drug nor a preventing vaccine is discovered. The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases, multivariate LSTM models is employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% as compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis and city-specific analysis of COVID-19 cases for India and Chennai, respectively, are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID-19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.

AB Purpose This paper aims to discuss the effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management practices and outlines a three-pronged research agenda to stimulate knowledge development in the hotel sector. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on an overview of the relevant literature on hotel marketing and management and the hotel guest behavior. The authors also investigated hospitality service trends to propose a research agenda. Findings This paper presents a research agenda from three dimensions - artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, hygiene and cleanliness and health and health care. First, different types of AI (mechanical, thinking and feeling) might open up distinct research streams at the intersection of health crises and hotel management, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this paper recommends that researchers move beyond typical perspectives on the antecedents and outcomes of hotel hygiene and cleanliness to delve into guests' perceptions of the cleanliness of specific hotel surfaces. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis is warranted about the evolving relationship between hotels and the health-care sector. Practical implications The recommended research areas are intended to advance the knowledge base to help hotels recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The suggested research streams are expected to provide actionable insights to promote the development and sustainability of the hotel sector. Originality/value This paper appears to be a frontier study, critically examining possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hotel marketing and management practices and how hoteliers may respond to such challenges to recover after this pandemic.

AB Interactive technology is rapidly transforming the modern e-tail landscape by applying reality-enhancing technologies, i.e., augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality-led sensory, emotional and cognitive mechanisms. These wide-ranging AI-enabled services improve user interface and enhance customers' experience in the online shopping environment. The current study integrated the flow dimensions and the broaden-and-build theory to investigate the moderating influence of AI-enabled service quality on flow dimensions and customers' awe experience. The model examined the role of online flow dimensions, i.e., perceived control, concentration, and cognitive enjoyment, in using AI-enabled services to enhance customers' awe experience in the Indian fashion e-tailing context. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze and validate a sample of 739 online fashion retail shoppers. The findings posited that individuals are encouraged by the (1) concentration and (2) cognitive enjoyment facilitated by online flow, and in the case of (3) perceived control, the effect size was small. Further, the moderating role of AI-enabled service in deepening and positively influencing the awe experience with perceived control, concentration, and cognitive enjoyment was also established.

AB This study addresses two critical research gaps in human-robot interaction (HRI): the limited systematic research on the role of trust in customers' acceptance of artificially intelligent (AI) robots; and the lack of understanding of robot acceptance under different cultural backgrounds. Drawing on the AIDUA framework, this study examines the impacts of trust and moderating effects of both national (the U.S. and China) and individual culture on customers' intentions to use AI robots in hospitality services by developing a theoretical model. The model is tested on data collected using online data collection platforms from 491 U.S. and 495 Chinese respondents. PLS-SEM and the bootstrapping method were used to test the hypothesized relationships and analyze the moderating effects of culture, respectively. The findings suggest that trust in interaction with AI robots is a significant higher -order construct that influences the intention of use. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and power distance have been found to exhibit significant moderation effects. The results of this study extend the theoretical frameworks in HRI and provide detailed guidance to promote AI robot applications across different cultures.

AB The paradigm of edge computing has formed an innovative scope within the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT) through expanding the services of the cloud to the network edge to design distributed architectures and securely enhance decision-making applications. Due to the heterogeneous, distributed and resource-constrained essence of edge Computing, edge applications are required to be developed as a set of lightweight and interdependent modules. As this concept aligns with the objectives of microservice architecture, effective implementation of microservices-based edge applications within IoT networks has the prospective of fully leveraging edge nodes capabilities. Deploying microservices at IoT edge faces plenty of challenges associated with security and privacy. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) (especially Machine Learning), and the easy access to resources with powerful computing providing opportunities for deriving precise models and developing different intelligent applications at the edge of network. In this study, an extensive survey is presented for securing edge computing-based AI Microservices to elucidate the challenges of IoT management and enable secure decision-making systems at the edge. We present recent research studies on edge AI and microservices orchestration and highlight key requirements as well as challenges of securing Microservices at IoT edge. We also propose a Microservices-based edge computing framework that provides secure edge AI algorithms as Microservices utilizing the containerization technology to offer automated and secure AI-based applications at the network edge.

AB Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a menace that is affecting 10 percent of the world population and 15 percent of the South African population. The early and cheap diagnosis of this disease with accuracy and reliability will save 20,000 lives in South Africa per year. Scientists are developing smart solutions with Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, several typical and recent AI algorithms are studied in the context of CKD and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is chosen as our base model for its high performance. Then, the model is optimized and the optimal full model trained on all the features achieves a testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively. Note that, to cover the widest range of people, the time and monetary costs of CKD diagnosis have to be minimized with fewest patient tests. Thus, the reduced model using fewer features is desirable while it should still maintain high performance. To this end, the set-theory based rule is presented which combines a few feature selection methods with their collective strengths. The reduced model using about a half of the original full features performs better than the models based on individual feature selection methods and achieves accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, of 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively.

AB PurposeThe article discusses the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI) in research and how AI improves various research methods. This article focuses on the practical case study of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to provide a guideline for employing AI in the process.Design/methodology/approachResearchers no longer require technical skills to use AI in their research. The recent discussion about using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a chatbot by OpenAI, has reached the academic world and fueled heated debates about the future of academic research. Nevertheless, as the saying goes, AI will not replace our job; a human being using AI will. This editorial aims to provide an overview of the current state of using AI in research, highlighting recent trends and developments in the field.FindingsThe main result is guidelines for the use of AI in the scientific research process. The guidelines were developed for the literature review case but the authors believe the instructions provided can be adjusted to many fields of research, including but not limited to quantitative research, data qualification, research on unstructured data, qualitative data and even on many support functions and repetitive tasks.Originality/valueAI already has the potential to make researchers' work faster, more reliable and more convenient. The authors highlight the advantages and limitations of AI in the current time, which should be present in any research utilizing AI. Advantages include objectivity and repeatability in research processes that currently are subject to human error. The most substantial disadvantages lie in the architecture of current general-purpose models, which understanding is essential for using them in research. The authors will describe the most critical shortcomings without going into technical detail and suggest how to work with the shortcomings daily.

ID CLASSIFICATION; ENDOSCOPY
AB Background and Aims: The prognosis of esophageal cancer is relatively poor. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has made remarkable progress in medicine. However, there are no reports on its application for diagnosing esophageal cancer. Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.
   Methods: We retrospectively collected 8428 training images of esophageal cancer from 384 patients at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Japan. Using these, we developed deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also prepared 1118 test images for 47 patients with 49 esophageal cancers and 50 patients without esophageal cancer to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.
   Results: The CNN took 27 seconds to analyze 1118 test images and correctly detected esophageal cancer cases with a sensitivity of 98%. CNN could detect all 7 small cancer lesions less than 10mmin size. Although the positive predictive value for each image was 40%, misdiagnosing shadows and normal structures led to a negative predictive value of 95%. The CNN could distinguish superficial esophageal cancer from advanced cancer with an accuracy of 98%.
   Conclusions: The constructed CNN system for detecting esophageal cancer can analyze stored endoscopic images in a short time with high sensitivity. However, more training would lead to higher diagnostic accuracy. This system can facilitate early detection in practice, leading to a better prognosis in the near future.

AB Intelligent manufacturing is a general concept that is under continuous development. It can be categorized into three basic paradigms: digital manufacturing, digital-networked manufacturing, and new-generation intelligent manufacturing. New-generation intelligent manufacturing represents an indepth integration of new-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology and advanced manufacturing technology. It runs through every link in the full life-cycle of design, production, product, and service. The concept also relates to the optimization and integration of corresponding systems; the continuous improvement of enterprises' product quality, performance, and service levels; and reduction in resources consumption. New-generation intelligent manufacturing acts as the core driving force of the new industrial revolution and will continue to be the main pathway for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry in the decades to come. Human-cyber-physical systems (HCPSs) reveal the technological mechanisms of new-generation intelligent manufacturing and can effectively guide related theoretical research and engineering practice. Given the sequential development, cross interaction, and iterative upgrading characteristics of the three basic paradigms of intelligent manufacturing, a technology roadmap for "parallel promotion and integrated development" should be developed in order to drive forward the intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry in China.

AB Due to its limited intelligence and abilities, machine learning is currently unable to handle various situations thus cannot completely replace humans in real-world applications. Because humans exhibit robustness and adaptability in complex scenarios, it is crucial to introduce humans into the training loop of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging human intelligence to further advance machine learning algo-rithms. In this study, a real-time human-guidance-based (Hug)-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is developed for policy training in an end-to-end autonomous driving case. With our newly designed mechanism for control transfer between humans and automation, humans are able to intervene and correct the agent's unreasonable actions in real time when necessary during the model training pro-cess. Based on this human-in-the-loop guidance mechanism, an improved actor-critic architecture with modified policy and value networks is developed. The fast convergence of the proposed Hug-DRL allows real-time human guidance actions to be fused into the agent's training loop, further improving the effi-ciency and performance of DRL. The developed method is validated by human-in-the-loop experiments with 40 subjects and compared with other state-of-the-art learning approaches. The results suggest that the proposed method can effectively enhance the training efficiency and performance of the DRL algo-rithm under human guidance without imposing specific requirements on participants' expertise or experience.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

ID OPTIMIZATION; QUALITY
AB Machine learning tools are used to greatly accelerate chip layout design, by posing chip floorplanning as a reinforcement learning problem and using neural networks to generate high-performance chip layouts.
   Chip floorplanning is the engineering task of designing the physical layout of a computer chip. Despite five decades of research(1), chip floorplanning has defied automation, requiring months of intense effort by physical design engineers to produce manufacturable layouts. Here we present a deep reinforcement learning approach to chip floorplanning. In under six hours, our method automatically generates chip floorplans that are superior or comparable to those produced by humans in all key metrics, including power consumption, performance and chip area. To achieve this, we pose chip floorplanning as a reinforcement learning problem, and develop an edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferable representations of the chip. As a result, our method utilizes past experience to become better and faster at solving new instances of the problem, allowing chip design to be performed by artificial agents with more experience than any human designer. Our method was used to design the next generation of Google's artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, and has the potential to save thousands of hours of human effort for each new generation. Finally, we believe that more powerful AI-designed hardware will fuel advances in AI, creating a symbiotic relationship between the two fields.

AB Advances in information and signal processing technologies have a significant impact on autonomous driving (AD), improving driving safety while minimizing the efforts of human drivers with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have solved several real-world problems of complex nature. However, their strengths in terms of control processes for AD have not been deeply investigated and highlighted yet. This survey highlights the power of DL architectures in terms of reliability and efficient real-time performance and overviews state-of-the-art strategies for safe AD, with their major achievements and limitations. Furthermore, it covers major embodiments of DL along the AD pipeline including measurement, analysis, and execution, with a focus on road, lane, vehicle, pedestrian, drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and traffic sign detection through sensing and vision-based DL methods. In addition, we discuss on the performance of several reviewed methods by using different evaluation metrics, with critics on their pros and cons. Finally, this survey highlights the current issues of safe DL-based AD with a prospect of recommendations for future research, rounding up a reference material for newcomers and researchers willing to join this vibrant area of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

AB Looking at human communication from the perspective of semiotics extends our view beyond verbal language to consider other sign systems and meaning-making resources. Those include gestures, body language, images, and sounds. From this perspective, the communicative process expands from individual mental processes of verbalizing to include features of the environment, the place and space in which the communication occurs. It may be-and it is increasingly the case today-that language is mediated through digital networks. Online communication has become multimodal in virtually all platforms. At the same time, mobile devices have become indispensable digital companions, extending our perceptive and cognitive abilities. Advances in artificial intelligence are enabling tools that have considerable potential for language learning, as well as creating more complexity in the relationship between humans and the material world. In this column, we will be looking at changing perspectives on the role of place and space in language learning, as mobile, embedded, virtual, and reality-augmenting technologies play an ever-increasing role in our lives. Understanding that dynamic is aided by theories and frameworks such as 4E cognition and sociomaterialism, which posit closer connections between human cognition/language and the world around us.

AB According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.

AB We show, based on ratings by finance journal reviewers of generated output, that the recently released AI chatbot ChatGPT can significantly assist with finance research. In principle, these results should be generalisable across research domains. There are clear advantages for idea generation and data identification. The technology, however, is weaker on literature synthesis and developing appropriate testing frameworks. Importantly, we further demonstrate that the extent of private data and researcher domain expertise input, are key factors in determining the quality of output. We conclude by considering the implications, particularly the ethical implications, which arise from this new technology.

AB After growing up together, and mostly growing apart in the second half of the 20th century, the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science, and neuroscience are reconverging on a shared view of the computational foundations of intelligence that promotes valuable cross-disciplinary exchanges on questions, methods, and results. We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

AB Due to increasing complexity, uncertainty and data dimensions in power systems, conventional methods often meet bottlenecks when attempting to solve decision and control problems. Therefore, data-driven methods toward solving such problems are being extensively studied. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of these data-driven methods and is regarded as real artificial intelligence (AI). DRL is a combination of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). This field of research has been applied to solve a wide range of complex sequential decision-making problems, including those in power systems. This paper firstly reviews the basic ideas, models, algorithms and techniques of DRL. Applications in power systems such as energy management, demand response, electricity market, operational control, and others are then considered. In addition, recent advances in DRL including the combination of RL with other classical methods, and the prospect and challenges of applications in power systems are also discussed.

AB There is great excitement that medical artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) can be used to improve decision making at the patient level in a variety of healthcare settings. However, the quantification and communication of uncertainty for individual predictions is often neglected even though uncertainty estimates could lead to more principled decision-making and enable machine learning models to automatically or semi-automatically abstain on samples for which there is high uncertainty. In this article, we provide an overview of different approaches to uncertainty quantification and abstention for machine learning and highlight how these techniques could improve the safety and reliability of current ML systems being used in healthcare settings. Effective quantification and communication of uncertainty could help to engender trust with healthcare workers, while providing safeguards against known failure modes of current machine learning approaches. As machine learning becomes further integrated into healthcare environments, the ability to say "I'm not sure" or "I don't know" when uncertain is a necessary capability to enable safe clinical deployment.

AB Customers increasingly orchestrate their everyday activities with the support of technology, with services in-creasingly adopting AI-based applications. Yet, research is still in its infancy and has been largely conceptual. Therefore, based on data collected from 238 young consumers, analyzed using PLS-SEM, this study focuses on users' motivations to adopt intelligent digital voice assistants in service encounters. Findings show that functional, social and relational elements drive adoption, untangle crossover effects between them and reveal the moderating role of experience and need for human interaction. While empirically validating and extending the Service Robot Acceptance Model by Wirtz and colleagues, this study provides evidence that anthropomorphism is not universally positive and adds a new perspective regarding the underexplored role of customer-robot rapport building. The study contributes to a more holistic understanding of digital voice assistants' adoption and provides managerial guidance on how to successfully implement such technologies.

TI AlphaFold accelerates artificial intelligence powered drug discovery:
   efficient discovery of a novel CDK20 small molecule inhibitor
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE

ID CYCLE-RELATED KINASE; CCRK
AB The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been considered a revolutionary change in drug discovery and development. In 2020, the AlphaFold computer program predicted protein structures for the whole human genome, which has been considered a remarkable breakthrough in both AI applications and structural biology. Despite the varying confidence levels, these predicted structures could still significantly contribute to structure-based drug design of novel targets, especially the ones with no or limited structural information. In this work, we successfully applied AlphaFold to our end-to-end AI-powered drug discovery engines, including a biocomputational platform PandaOmics and a generative chemistry platform Chemistry42. A novel hit molecule against a novel target without an experimental structure was identified, starting from target selection towards hit identification, in a cost- and time-efficient manner. PandaOmics provided the protein of interest for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold, and the selected molecules were synthesized and tested in biological assays. Through this approach, we identified a small molecule hit compound for cyclin-dependent kinase 20 (CDK20) with a binding constant Kd value of 9.2 +/- 0.5 mu M (n = 3) within 30 days from target selection and after only synthesizing 7 compounds. Based on the available data, a second round of AI-powered compound generation was conducted and through this, a more potent hit molecule, ISM042-2-048, was discovered with an average Kd value of 566.7 +/- 256.2 nM (n = 3). Compound ISM042-2-048 also showed good CDK20 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 33.4 +/- 22.6 nM (n = 3). In addition, ISM042-2-048 demonstrated selective anti-proliferation activity in an HCC cell line with CDK20 overexpression, Huh7, with an IC50 of 208.7 +/- 3.3 nM, compared to a counter screen cell line HEK293 (IC50 = 1706.7 +/- 670.0 nM). This work is the first demonstration of applying AlphaFold to the hit identification process in drug discovery.

AB In parallel with the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) empowered by advances in AI research, there has been growing awareness and concerns of data privacy. Recent significant developments in the data regulation landscape have prompted a seismic shift in interest toward privacy-preserving AI. This has contributed to the popularity of Federated Learning (FL), the leading paradigm for the training of machine learning models on data silos in a privacy-preserving manner. In this survey, we explore the domain of personalized FL (PFL) to address the fundamental challenges of FL on heterogeneous data, a universal characteristic inherent in all real-world datasets. We analyze the key motivations for PFL and present a unique taxonomy of PFL techniques categorized according to the key challenges and personalization strategies in PFL. We highlight their key ideas, challenges, opportunities, and envision promising future trajectories of research toward a new PFL architectural design, realistic PFL benchmarking, and trustworthy PFL approaches.

AB Firms apply strategic foresight in technology and innovation management to detect discontinuous changes early, to assess their expected consequences, and to develop a future course of action enabling superior company performance. For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. Based on our findings, we derive both theoretical and practical implications for the technology and innovation management of firms, and we suggest future research opportunities to further advance this field.

ID VISION
AB As the 50 communication networks are being widely deployed worldwide, both industry and academia have started to move beyond 50 and explore 6G communications. It is generally believed that 6G will be established on ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve data-driven Machine Learning (ML) solutions in heterogeneous and massive-scale networks. However, traditional ML techniques require centralized data collection and processing by a central server, which is becoming a bottleneck of large-scale implementation in daily life due to significantly increasing privacy concerns. Federated learning, as an emerging distributed AI approach with privacy preservation nature, is particularly attractive for various wireless applications, especially being treated as one of the vital solutions to achieve ubiquitous AI in 6G. In this article, we first introduce the integration of 6G and federated learning and provide potential federated learning applications for 6G. We then describe key technical challenges, the corresponding federated learning methods, and open problems for future research on federated learning in the context of 6G communications.

AB Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful(1). Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives(2). Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.

AB The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in geohazard modelling has been rapidly growing in recent years, a trend that is observed in several research and application areas thanks to recent advances in AI. As a result, the increasing dependence on data driven studies has made its prac-tical applications towards geohazards (landslides, debris flows, earthquakes, droughts, floods, glacier studies) an interesting prospect. These aforementioned geohazards were responsible for roughly 80% of the economic loss in the past two decades caused by all natural hazards. The present study analyses the various domains of geohazards which have benefited from classical machine learning approaches and highlights the future course of direction in this field. The emergence of deep learning has fulfilled several gaps in: i) classification; ii) seasonal forecasting as well as forecasting at longer lead times; iii) temporal based change detection. Apart from the usual challenges of dataset availability, climate change and anthropogenic activities, this review paper emphasizes that the future studies should focus on con-secutive events along with integration of physical models. The recent catastrophe in Japan and Australia makes a compelling argument to focus towards consecutive events. The availability of higher temporal resolution and multi-hazard dataset will prove to be essential, but the key would be to integrate it with physical models which would improve our understanding of the mechanism involved both in single and consecutive hazard scenario. Geohazards would eventually be a data problem, like geosciences, and therefore it is essential to develop models that would be capable of handling large voluminous data. The future works should also revolve towards interpretable models with the hope of providing a reason-able explanation of the results, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of Explainable AI.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed key aspects of human life. Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI wherein machines autonomously acquire information by extracting patterns from large databases, has been increasingly used within the medical community, and specifically within the domain of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present a brief overview of ML methodologies that are used for the construction of inferential and predictive data-driven models. We highlight several domains of ML application such as echocardiography, electrocardiography, and recently developed non-invasive imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography. We conclude by reviewing the limitations associated with contemporary application of ML algorithms within the cardiovascular disease field.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long promised to increase healthcare affordability, quality and accessibility but FDA, until recently, had never authorized an autonomous AI diagnostic system. This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22-84 years); among participants, 47.5% of participants were male; 16.1% were Hispanic, 83.3% not Hispanic; 28.6% African American and 63.4% were not; 198 (23.8%) had mtmDR. The AI system exceeded all pre-specified superiority endpoints at sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI, 81.8-91.2%) (> 85%), specificity of 90.7% (95% CI, 88.3-92.7%) (> 82.5%), and imageability rate of 96.1% (95% CI, 94.6-97.3%), demonstrating AI's ability to bring specialty-level diagnostics to primary care settings. Based on these results, FDA authorized the system for use by health care providers to detect more than mild DR and diabetic macular edema, making it, the first FDA authorized autonomous AI diagnostic system in any field of medicine, with the potential to help prevent vision loss in thousands of people with diabetes annually.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have driven impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years, exceeding human performance in domains ranging from Atari to Go to no-limit poker. This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient that is, it may simply be too slow - to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning.

AB Forecasting the performance and energy yield of photovoltaic (PV) farms is crucial for establishing the economic sustainability of a newly installed system. The present study aims to develop a prediction model to forecast an installed PV system's annual power generation yield and performance ratio (PR) using three environmental input parameters: solar irradiance, wind speed, and ambient air temperature. Three data-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), response surface methodology (RSM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were employed. The models were developed using three years of data from an operational 2MWp Solar PV Project at Kuzhalmannam, Kerala state, India. Statistical indices such as Pearson's R, coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSCE), mean absolute-percentage error (MAPE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Taylor's diagram, and correlation matrix were used to determine the most accurate prediction model. The results demonstrate that ANFIS was the most precise performance ratio prediction model, with an R-2 value of 0.9830 and an RMSE of 0.6. It is envisaged that the forecast model would be a valuable tool for policymakers, solar energy researchers, and solar farm developers.

AB BACKGROUND: Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) can be integrated within standard clinical software to facilitate the acceptance of the diagnostic findings during clinical interpretation.
   OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop and evaluate a novel, general purpose, explainable deep learning model (coronary artery disease-deep learning [CAD-DL]) for the detection of obstructive CAD following single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).
   METHODS: A total of 3,578 patients with suspected CAD undergoing SPECT MPI and invasive coronary angiography within a 6-month interval from 9 centers were studied. CAD-DL computes the probability of obstructive CAD from stress myocardial perfusion, wall motion, and wall thickening maps, as well as left ventricular volumes, age, and sex. Myocardial regions contributing to the CAD-DL prediction are highlighted to explain the findings to the physician. A clinical prototype was integrated using a standard clinical workstation. Diagnostic performance by CAD-DL was compared to automated quantitative total perfusion deficit (TPD) and reader diagnosis.
   RESULTS: In total, 2,247 patients (63%) had obstructive CAD. In 10-fold repeated testing, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) (95% CI) was higher according to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.82-0.85]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.77-0.80]) or reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.69-0.72]; P < 0.0001 for both). In external testing, the AUC in 555 patients was higher according to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.76-0.84]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.69-0.77]) or reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.61-0.69]; P < 0.001 for all). The present model can be integrated within standard clinical software and generates results rapidly (<12 seconds on a standard clinical workstation) and therefore could readily be incorporated into a typical clinical workflow.
   CONCLUSIONS: The deep-learning model significantly surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of standard quantitative analysis and clinical visual reading for MPI. Explainable artificial intelligence can be integrated within standard clinical software to facilitate acceptance of artificial intelligence diagnosis of CAD following MPI.

AB ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational large language model (LLM). The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a code of ethics to guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health care and academia.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Microscopic inflammation has signif-icant prognostic value in ulcerative colitis (UC); however, its assessment is complex with high interobserver variability. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided diagnosis system to evaluate UC biopsies and predict prognosis. METHODS: A total of 535 digitalized biopsies (273 patients) were graded according to the PICaSSO Histologic Remission Index (PHRI), Robarts, and Nancy Histo-logical Index. A convolutional neural network classifier was trained to distinguish remission from activity on a subset of 118 biopsies, calibrated on 42 and tested on 375. The model was additionally tested to predict the corresponding endo-scopic assessment and occurrence of flares at 12 months. The system output was compared with human assessment. Diag-nostic performance was reported as sensitivity, specificity, prognostic prediction through Kaplan-Meier, and hazard ratios of flares between active and remission groups. We externally validated the model in 154 biopsies (58 patients) with similar characteristics but more histologically active patients. RESULTS: The system distinguished histological activity/ remission with sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 85% (PHRI), 94% and 76% (Robarts Histological Index), and 89% and 79% (Nancy Histological Index). The model predicted the cor-responding endoscopic remission/activity with 79% and 82% accuracy for UC endoscopic index of severity and Paddington International virtual ChromoendoScopy ScOre, respectively. The hazard ratio for disease flare-up between histological activity/ remission groups according to pathologist-assessed PHRI was 3.56, and 4.64 for AI-assessed PHRI. Both histology and outcome prediction were confirmed in the external validation cohort. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an AI model that distinguishes histologic remission/activity in biopsies of UC and predicts flare-ups. This can expedite, standardize, and enhance histologic assessment in practice and trials.

TI A large language model for electronic health records
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model-GatorTron-using > 90 billion words of text (including > 82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a new breed of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that builds upon decentralized data and training that brings learning to the edge or directly on-device. FL is a new research area often referred to as a new dawn in AI, is in its infancy, and has not yet gained much trust in the community, mainly because of its (unknown) security and privacy implications. To advance the state of the research in this area and to realize extensive utilization of the FL approach and its mass adoption, its security and privacy concerns must be first identified, evaluated, and documented. FL is preferred in use-cases where security and privacy are the key concerns and having a clear view and understanding of risk factors enable an implementer/adopter of FL to successfully build a secure environment and gives researchers a clear vision on possible research areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study concerning FL's security and privacy aspects that can help bridge the gap between the current state of federated AI and a future in which mass adoption is possible. We present an illustrative description of approaches and various implementation styles with an examination of the current challenges in FL and establish a detailed review of security and privacy concerns that need to be considered in a thorough and clear context. Findings from our study suggest that overall there are fewer privacy-specific threats associated with FL compared to security threats. The most specific security threats currently are communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks while inference-based attacks are the most critical to the privacy of FL. We conclude the paper with much needed future research directions to make FL adaptable in realistic scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The popularity of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools remains debated. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, failing to synthesise the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL, starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact ecological data analysis in the future. We conclude that ML and DL are powerful new tools for predictive modelling and data analysis. The superior performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an indispensable tool in ecology and evolution, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.

AB Background Retrospective studies have shown promising results using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve mammography screening accuracy and reduce screen-reading workload; however, to our knowledge, a randomised trial has not yet been conducted. We aimed to assess the clinical safety of an AI-supported screen-reading protocol compared with standard screen reading by radiologists following mammography. Methods In this randomised, controlled, population-based trial, women aged 40-80 years eligible for mammography screening (including general screening with 1 & BULL;5-2-year intervals and annual screening for those with moderate hereditary risk of breast cancer or a history of breast cancer) at four screening sites in Sweden were informed about the study as part of the screening invitation. Those who did not opt out were randomly allocated (1:1) to AI-supported screening (intervention group) or standard double reading without AI (control group). Screening examinations were automatically randomised by the Picture Archive and Communications System with a pseudo-random number generator after image acquisition. The participants and the radiographers acquiring the screening examinations, but not the radiologists reading the screening examinations, were masked to study group allocation. The AI system (Transpara version 1.7.0) provided an examination-based malignancy risk score on a 10-level scale that was used to triage screening examinations to single reading (score 1-9) or double reading (score 10), with AI risk scores (for all examinations) and computer-aided detection marks (for examinations with risk score 8-10) available to the radiologists doing the screen reading. Here we report the prespecified clinical safety analysis, to be done after 80 000 women were enrolled, to assess the secondary outcome measures of early screening performance (cancer detection rate, recall rate, false positive rate, positive predictive value [PPV] of recall, and type of cancer detected [invasive or in situ]) and screen-reading workload. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, all women randomly assigned to a group with one complete screening examination, excluding women recalled due to enlarged lymph nodes diagnosed with lymphoma). The lowest acceptable limit for safety in the intervention group was a cancer detection rate of more than 3 per 1000 participants screened. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838756, and is closed to accrual; follow-up is ongoing to assess the primary endpoint of the trial, interval cancer rate. Findings Between April 12, 2021, and July 28, 2022, 80 033 women were randomly assigned to AI-supported screening (n=40 003) or double reading without AI (n=40 030). 13 women were excluded from the analysis. The median age was 54 & BULL;0 years (IQR 46 & BULL;7-63 & BULL;9). Race and ethnicity data were not collected. AI-supported screening among 39 996 participants resulted in 244 screen-detected cancers, 861 recalls, and a total of 46 345 screen readings. Standard screening among 40 024 participants resulted in 203 screen-detected cancers, 817 recalls, and a total of 83 231 screen readings. Cancer detection rates were 6 & BULL;1 (95% CI 5 & BULL;4-6 & BULL;9) per 1000 screened participants in the intervention group, above the lowest acceptable limit for safety, and 5 & BULL;1 (4 & BULL;4-5 & BULL;8) per 1000 in the control group-a ratio of 1 & BULL;2 (95% CI 1 & BULL;0-1 & BULL;5; p=0 & BULL;052).
   Recall rates were 2 & BULL;2% (95% CI 2 & BULL;0-2 & BULL;3) in the intervention group and 2 & BULL;0% (1 & BULL;9-2 & BULL;2) in the control group. The false positive rate was 1 & BULL;5% (95% CI 1 & BULL;4-1 & BULL;7) in both groups. The PPV of recall was 28 & BULL;3% (95% CI 25 & BULL;3-31 & BULL;5) in the intervention group and 24 & BULL;8% (21 & BULL;9-28 & BULL;0) in the control group. In the intervention group, 184 (75%) of 244 cancers detected were invasive and 60 (25%) were in situ; in the control group, 165 (81%) of 203 cancers were invasive and 38 (19%) were in situ. The screen-reading workload was reduced by 44 & BULL;3% using AI. Interpretation AI-supported mammography screening resulted in a similar cancer detection rate compared with standard double reading, with a substantially lower screen-reading workload, indicating that the use of AI in mammography screening is safe. The trial was thus not halted and the primary endpoint of interval cancer rate will be assessed in 100 000 enrolled participants after 2-years of follow up.

AB The circular economy (CE) has the potential to capitalise upon emerging digital technologies, such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and the Internet of things (IoT), amongst others. These digital technologies combined with business model innovation are deemed to provide solutions to myriad problems in the world, including those related to circular economy transformation. Given the societal and practical importance of CE and digitalisation, last decade has witnessed a significant increase in academic publication on these topics. Therefore, this study aims to capture the essence of the scholarly work at the intersection of the CE and digital technologies. A detailed analysis of the literature based on emerging themes was conducted with a focus on illuminating the path of CE implementation. The results reveal that IoT and AI play a key role in the transition towards the CE. A multitude of studies focus on barriers to digitalisation-led CE transition and highlight policy-related issues, the lack of predictability, psychological issues and information vulnerability as some important barriers. In addition, product-service system (PSS) has been acknowledged as an important business model innovation for achieving the digitalisation enabled CE. Through a detailed assessment of the existing literature, a viable systems-based framework for digitalisation enabled CE has been developed which show the literature linkages amongst the emerging research streams and provide novel insights regarding the realisation of CE benefits.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB AimChatbot Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) software based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate human conversations and generate novel content based on the training data it has been exposed to. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of ChatGPT-generated answers to clinical questions in endodontics, compared to answers provided by human experts.MethodologyNinety-one dichotomous (yes/no) questions were designed and categorized into three levels of difficulty. Twenty questions were randomly selected from each difficulty level. Sixty answers were generated by ChatGPT for each question. Two endodontic experts independently answered the 60 questions. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program to calculate the consistency and accuracy of the answers generated by ChatGPT compared to the experts. Confidence intervals (95%) and standard deviations were used to estimate variability.ResultsThe answers generated by ChatGPT showed high consistency (85.44%). No significant differences in consistency were found based on question difficulty. In terms of answer accuracy, ChatGPT achieved an average accuracy of 57.33%. However, significant differences in accuracy were observed based on question difficulty, with lower accuracy for easier questions.ConclusionsCurrently, ChatGPT is not capable of replacing dentists in clinical decision-making. As ChatGPT's performance improves through deep learning, it is expected to become more useful and effective in the field of endodontics. However, careful attention and ongoing evaluation are needed to ensure its accuracy, reliability and safety in endodontics.

AB An intelligent manufacturing system is a composite intelligent system comprising humans, cyber systems, and physical systems with the aim of achieving specific manufacturing goals at an optimized level. This kind of intelligent system is called a human-cyber-physical system (HCPS). In terms of technology, HCPSs can both reveal technological principles and form the technological architecture for intelligent manufacturing. It can be concluded that the essence of intelligent manufacturing is to design, construct, and apply HCPSs in various cases and at different levels. With advances in information technology, intelligent manufacturing has passed through the stages of digital manufacturing and digital-networked manufacturing, and is evolving toward new-generation intelligent manufacturing (NGIM). NGIM is characterized by the in-depth integration of new-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology (i.e., enabling technology) with advanced manufacturing technology (i.e., root technology); it is the core driving force of the new industrial revolution. In this study, the evolutionary footprint of intelligent manufacturing is reviewed from the perspective of HCPSs, and the implications, characteristics, technical frame, and key technologies of HCPSs for NGIM are then discussed in depth. Finally, an outlook of the major challenges of HCPSs for NGIM is proposed. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

AB The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) increased the diagnostic burden of radiologists. In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hope artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. In this paper, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images and provides the probability of infection to rapidly detect COVID-19 pneumonia. The proposed system which consists of classification and segmentation will save about 30%-40% of the detection time for physicians and promote the performance of COVID-19 detection. Specifically, working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and/or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we are able to overcome a series of challenges (e.g. data discrepancy, testing time-effectiveness of model, data security, etc.) in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. In addition, since the proposed AI system provides the priority of each CT image with probability of infection, the physicians can confirm and segregate the infected patients in time. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we are able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases.

AB With the fast development of the fifth-generation cellular network technology (5G), the future sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)/nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are presenting a more and more critical role to provide information in our daily life. This review paper introduces the development trends and perspectives of the future sensors and MEMS/NEMS. Starting from the issues of the MEMS fabrication, we introduced typical MEMS sensors for their applications in the Internet of Things (IoTs), such as MEMS physical sensor, MEMS acoustic sensor, and MEMS gas sensor. Toward the trends in intelligence and less power consumption, MEMS components including MEMS/NEMS switch, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT), and MEMS energy harvesting were investigated to assist the future sensors, such as event-based or almost zero-power. Furthermore, MEMS rigid substrate toward NEMS flexible-based for flexibility and interface was discussed as another important development trend for next-generation wearable or multi-functional sensors. Around the issues about the big data and human-machine realization for human beings' manipulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies were finally realized using sensor nodes and its wave identification as future trends for various scenarios.

AB We study the impacts of "humanizing" artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled autonomous customer service agents (chatbots). Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays, and social presence. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer sensitivity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers' increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.

AB Edge Intelligence is an emerging technology which has attracted significant attention. It applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) closer to the network edge for supporting Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) needs. On the other hand, drones can be used as relay station (mobile drone edge intelligence) to gather data from smart environments. Federated Learning (FL) enables the drones to perform decentralized collaborative learning by developing local models, sharing the model parameters with neighbors and the centralized unit to improve global model accuracy in smart environments. However, drone edge intelligence faces challenges such as security and decentralization management, limiting its functions to support green smart environments. Blockchain is a promising technology that enables privacy-preserving data sharing in a distributed manner. There are several challenges that still need to be addressed in blockchain-based applications, such as scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction capacity. Motivated by the significance of FL and blockchain, this survey focuses on the synergy of FL and blockchain to enable drone edge intelligence for green sustainable environments. Moreover, we discuss the combination of FL and blockchain technological aspects, motivation, and framework for green smart environments. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities, and future trends in this domain.

AB The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy. In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory. Here we present an overview of current and next-generation methods for federated, secure and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence with a focus on medical imaging applications, alongside potential attack vectors and future prospects in medical imaging and beyond.
   Medical imaging data is often subject to privacy and intellectual property restrictions. AI techniques can help out by offering tools like federated learning to bridge the gap between personal data protection and data utilisation for research and clinical routine, but these tools need to be secure.

ID BIODEGRADATION
AB The release and prevalence of organic pollutants in an aqueous environment due to industrial discharges, agricultural operations, or inappropriate waste disposal is a huge threat to attaining sustainable development. As a result, wastewater treatment has attained a huge scope as it is evident from the number of articles published in recent years. Among the various techniques, bioremediation is one of the economical and eco-friendly means of wastewater treatment for the removal of organic pollutants. Microbial community and microalgae are the front runners of this process as they result in treated water and sludge or biomass formation. This mini review put forwards the types of organic pollutants and the bioremediation strategies using microbes and micro-algae, the role of genetically engineered microbes on the bio-remediation of organic pollutants and the recent applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that have been implemented for improving the efficiency of the methods. The gap between practicability and applicability of the bioremediation process was also identified in this review. In addition, the economics and future research needs are discussed as outcomes.

AB Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that was independently predicted, using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to be useful forCOVID-19 infection via proposed anti-cytokine effects and as an inhibitor of host cell viral propagation. We evaluated thein vitropharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated inCOVID-19 infection. We validated theAI-predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb-associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities forAAK1,BIKE, andGAK. Inhibition ofNAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids. These effects occurred at exposure levels seen clinically. In a case series of patients with bilateralCOVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline inSARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers, andIL-6 levels. Collectively, these data support further evaluation of the anti-cytokine and anti-viral activity of baricitinib and support its assessment in randomized trials in hospitalizedCOVID-19 patients.

TI Federated deep learning for detecting COVID-19 lung abnormalities in CT:
   a privacy-preserving multinational validation study
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE

DT Article
ID CONFIDENCE
AB Data privacy mechanisms are essential for rapidly scaling medical training databases to capture the heterogeneity of patient data distributions toward robust and generalizable machine learning systems. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a major focus of artificial intelligence (AI) is interpreting chest CT, which can be readily used in the assessment and management of the disease. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a federated learning method for detecting COVID-19 related CT abnormalities with external validation on patients from a multinational study. We recruited 132 patients from seven multinational different centers, with three internal hospitals from Hong Kong for training and testing, and four external, independent datasets from Mainland China and Germany, for validating model generalizability. We also conducted case studies on longitudinal scans for automated estimation of lesion burden for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We explore the federated learning algorithms to develop a privacy-preserving AI model for COVID-19 medical image diagnosis with good generalization capability on unseen multinational datasets. Federated learning could provide an effective mechanism during pandemics to rapidly develop clinically useful AI across institutions and countries overcoming the burden of central aggregation of large amounts of sensitive data.

ID SERVICE SELECTION
AB To enable the large scale and efficient deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the confluence of AI and Edge Computing has given rise to Edge Intelligence, which leverages on the computation and communication capabilities of end devices and edge servers to process data closer to where it is produced. One of the enabling technologies of Edge Intelligence is the privacy preserving machine learning paradigm known as Federated Learning (FL), which enables data owners to conduct model training without having to transmit their raw data to third-party servers. However, the FL network is envisioned to involve thousands of heterogeneous distributed devices. As a result, communication inefficiency remains a key bottleneck. To reduce node failures and device dropouts, the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework has been proposed whereby cluster heads are designated to support the data owners through intermediate model aggregation. This decentralized learning approach reduces the reliance on a central controller, e.g., the model owner. However, the issues of resource allocation and incentive design are not well-studied in the HFL framework. In this article, we consider a two-level resource allocation and incentive mechanism design problem. In the lower level, the cluster heads offer rewards in exchange for the data owners' participation, and the data owners are free to choose which cluster to join. Specifically, we apply the evolutionary game theory to model the dynamics of the cluster selection process. In the upper level, each cluster head can choose to serve a model owner, whereas the model owners have to compete amongst each other for the services of the cluster heads. As such, we propose a deep learning based auction mechanism to derive the valuation of each cluster head's services. The performance evaluation shows the uniqueness and stability of our proposed evolutionary game, as well as the revenue maximizing properties of the deep learning based auction.

AB It is widely acknowledged that the development of traditional terrestrial communication technologies cannot provide all users with fair and high quality services due to scarce network resources and limited coverage areas. To complement the terrestrial connection, especially for users in rural, disaster-stricken, or other difficult-to-serve areas, satellites, UAVs, and balloons have been utilized to relay communication signals. On this basis, SAGINs have been proposed to improve the users' QoE. However, compared with existing networks such as ad hoc networks and cellular networks, SAGINs are much more complex due to the various characteristics of three network segments. To improve the performance of SAGINs, researchers are facing many unprecedented challenges. In this article, we propose the AI technique to optimize SAGINs, as the AI technique has shown its predominant advantages in many applications. We first analyze several main challenges of SAGINs and explain how these problems can be solved by AI. Then, we consider the satellite traffic balance as an example and propose a deep learning based method to improve traffic control performance. Simulation results evaluate that the deep learning technique can be an efficient tool to improve the performance of SAGINs.

AB Drug repurposing involves the identification of new applications for existing drugs at a lower cost and in a shorter time. There are different computational drug-repurposing strategies and some of these approaches have been applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Computational drug-repositioning approaches applied to COVID-19 can be broadly categorized into (i) network-based models, (ii) structure-based approaches and (iii) artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. Network-based approaches are divided into two categories: network-based clustering approaches and network-based propagation approaches. Both of them allowed to annotate some important patterns, to identify proteins that are functionally associated with COVID-19 and to discover novel drug-disease or drug-target relationships useful for new therapies. Structure-based approaches allowed to identify small chemical compounds able to bind macromolecular targets to evaluate how a chemical compound can interact with the biological counterpart, trying to find new applications for existing drugs. AI-based networks appear, at the moment, less relevant since they need more data for their application.

DE ChatGPT; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Rhinoplasty
AB Background ChatGPT is an open-source artificial large language model that uses deep learning to produce humanlike text dialogue. This observational study evaluated the ability of ChatGPT to provide informative and accurate responses to a set of hypothetical questions designed to simulate an initial consultation about rhinoplasty.
   Methods Nine questions were prompted to ChatGPT on rhinoplasty. The questions were sourced from a checklist published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and the responses were assessed for accessibility, informativeness, and accuracy by Specialist Plastic Surgeons with extensive experience in rhinoplasty.
   Results ChatGPT was able to provide coherent and easily comprehensible answers to the questions posed, demonstrating its understanding of natural language in a healthspecific context. The responses emphasized the importance of an individualized approach, particularly in aesthetic plastic surgery. However, the study also highlighted ChatGPT ' s limitations in providing more detailed or personalized advice.
   Conclusion Overall, the results suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to provide valuable information to patients in a medical context, particularly in situations where patients may be hesitant to seek advice from medical professionals or where access to medical advice is limited. However, further research is needed to determine the scope and limitations of AI language models in this domain and to assess the potential benefits and risks associated with their use.

AB As artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming more popular in landslide modeling, it is important to understand how decisions are made. Fairness, and transparency becomes ever more vital due to ethical concerns and trust. Despite the popularity of machine learning (ML) algorithms in landslide modeling, the explainability of these methods are often considered as black box. This paper aims to propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for landslide prediction using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) time-series data, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time-series data and other geoenvironmental factors such as DEM (digital elevation model) derivatives. We employed a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) approach to understand how and what decisions ML-based models are making. 37 features were extracted from various sources such as ALOS-PALSAR (ALOS Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), ALOS-2 (SAR), Landsat-8, topographic maps, and DEM for landslide susceptibility mapping in a landslide prone area in Chukha, Bhutan as a test site. The result was then compared using two standard ML methods: random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). As per results, the RF model outperformed (0.914) the SVM. Moreover, the higher reliability of the RF model was proved by the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.941. XAI results revealed, features like altitude, aspect, NDVI-2014, NDVI-2017, and NDVI-2018 were the most effective features for landslide prediction by both models. Interestingly, among those features, NDVI-2014, aspect, and NDVI-2017 negatively correlated with the landslide prediction; whereas positively correlated when SVM was utilized. This interpretation ability indicates the advantages of XAI over the conventional methods as it measures the impact, interaction and correlation of conditioning factors within a model. The current research finding can provide more transparency and explainability when working with MLs in landslide studies. This could help to build trust among the geoscientists and decision-makers while making geohazard prediction. (c) 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Artificial intelligence for diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer in
   biopsies: a population-based, diagnostic study
SO LANCET ONCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTEROBSERVER; PATHOLOGY; PATTERNS
AB Background An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a worldwide shortage of urological pathologists puts a strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability in grading can result in overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer. To alleviate these problems, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system with clinically acceptable accuracy for prostate cancer detection, localisation, and Gleason grading.
   Methods We digitised 6682 slides from needle core biopsies from 976 randomly selected participants aged 50-69 in the Swedish prospective and population-based STHLM3 diagnostic study done between May 28,2012, and Dec 30,2014 (ISRCTN84445406), and another 271 from 93 men from outside the study. The resulting images were used to train deep neural networks for assessment of prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test dataset comprising 1631 biopsies from 246 men from STHLM3 and an external validation dataset of 330 biopsies from 73 men. We also evaluated grading performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics and tumour extent predictions by correlating predicted cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the concordance between grades assigned by the AI system and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's kappa.
   Findings The AI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.997 (95% CI 0.994-0.999) for distinguishing between benign (n=910) and malignant (n=721) biopsy cores on the independent test dataset and 0.986 (0.972-0.996) on the external validation dataset (benign n=108, malignant n=222). The correlation between cancer length predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97) for the independent test dataset and 0.87 (0.84-0.90) for the external validation dataset. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved a mean pairwise kappa of 0.62, which was within the range of the corresponding values for the expert pathologists (0.60-0.73).
   Interpretation An AI system can be trained to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples at a ranking comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. Clinical application could reduce pathology workload by reducing the assessment of benign biopsies and by automating the task of measuring cancer length in positive biopsy cores. An AI system with expert-level grading performance might contribute a second opinion, aid in standardising grading, and provide pathology expertise in parts of the world where it does not exist.

AB This paper aims to highlight the potential applications and limits of a large language model (LLM) in healthcare. ChatGPT is a recently developed LLM that was trained on a massive dataset of text for dialogue with users. Although AI-based language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is uncertain how well they will perform in real-world scenarios, particularly in fields such as medicine where high-level and complex thinking is necessary. Furthermore, while the use of ChatGPT in writing scientific articles and other scientific outputs may have potential benefits, important ethical concerns must also be addressed. Consequently, we investigated the feasibility of ChatGPT in clinical and research scenarios: (1) support of the clinical practice, (2) scientific production, (3) misuse in medicine and research, and (4) reasoning about public health topics. Results indicated that it is important to recognize and promote education on the appropriate use and potential pitfalls of AI-based LLMs in medicine.

AB Given the considerable recent attention to distributed power generation and interest in sustainable energy, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems to grid-connected or isolated microgrids has become widespread. In order to maximize power output of PV system extensive research into control strategies for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods has been conducted. According to the robust, reliable, and fast performance of artificial intelligence-based MPPT methods, these approaches have been applied recently to various systems under different conditions. Given the diversity of recent advances to MPPT approaches a review focusing on the performance and reliability of these methods under diverse conditions is required. This paper reviews AI-based techniques proven to be effective and feasible to implement and very common in literature for MPPT, including their limitations and advantages. In order to support researchers in application of the reviewed techniques this study is not limited to reviewing the performance of recently adopted methods, rather discusses the background theory, application to MPPT systems, and important references relating to each method. It is envisioned that this review can be a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working with PV-based power systems to be able to access the basic theory behind each method, select the appropriate method according to project requirements, and implement MPPT systems to fulfill project objectives.

AB Although it has long been known that the immune cell composition has a strong prognostic and predictive value in colorectal cancer (CRC), scoring systems such as the immunoscore (IS) or quantification of intraepithelial lymphocytes are only slowly being adopted into clinical routine use and have their limitations. To address this we established and evaluated a multistain deep learning model (MSDLM) utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the AImmunoscore (AIS) in more than 1,000 patients with CRC. Our model had high prognostic capabilities and outperformed other clinical, molecular and immune cell-based parameters. It could also be used to predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer. Using an explainable AI approach, we confirmed that the MSDLM's decisions were based on established cellular patterns of anti-tumor immunity. Hence, the AIS could provide clinicians with a valuable decision-making tool based on the tumor immune microenvironment.

AB In many fields, complicated issues can now be solved with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). One of the more modern Metaheuristic (MH) algorithms used to tackle numerous issues in various fields is the Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO) method. However, BWO has a lack of diversity, which could lead to being trapped in local optimaand premature convergence. This study presents two stages for enhancing the fundamental BWO algorithm. The initial stage of BWO's Opposition-Based Learning (OBL), also known as OBWO, helps to expedite the search process and enhance the learning methodology to choose a better generation of candidate solutions for the fundamental BWO. The second step, referred to as OBWOD, combines the Dynamic Candidate Solution (DCS) and OBWO based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier to boost variety and improve the consistency of the selected solution by giving potential candidates a chance to solve the given problem with a high fitness value. A comparison study with present optimization algorithms for single-objective bound-constraint optimization problems was conducted to evaluate the performance of the OBWOD algorithm on issues from the 2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC'22) benchmark test suite with a range of dimension sizes. The results of the statistical significance test confirmed that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the optimization algorithms. In addition, the OBWOD algorithm surpassed the performance of seven other algorithms with an overall classification accuracy of 85.17% for classifying 10 medical datasets with different dimension sizes according to the performance evaluation matrix.

AB To plan the syntheses of small organic molecules, chemists use retrosynthesis, a problem-solving technique in which target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.

AB Human action recognition in videos is an active area of research in computer vision and pattern recognition. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) based systems are needed for human-behavior assessment and security purposes. The existing action recognition techniques are mainly using pre-trained weights of different AI architectures for the visual representation of video frames in the training stage, which affect the features' discrepancy determination, such as the distinction between the visual and temporal signs. To address this issue, we propose a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) based attention mechanism with a dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) that selectively focuses on effective features in the input frame to recognize the different human actions in the videos. In this diverse network, we use the DCNN layers to extract the salient discriminative features by using the residual blocks to upgrade the features that keep more information than a shallow layer. Furthermore, we feed these features into a BiLSTM to learn the long-term dependencies, which is followed by the attention mechanism to boost the performance and extract the additional high-level selective action related patterns and cues. We further use the center loss with Softmax to improve the loss function that achieves a higher performance in the video-based action classification. The proposed system is evaluated on three benchmarks, i.e., UCF11, UCF sports, and J-HMDB datasets for which it achieved a recognition rate of 98.3%, 99.1%, and 80.2%, respectively, showing 1%-3% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

AB Purpose The service sector is at an inflection point with regard to productivity gains and service industrialization similar to the industrial revolution in manufacturing that started in the eighteenth century. Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature.
   Findings The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level.
   Practical implications This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots.
   Originality/value This is the first conceptual paper that systematically examines key dimensions of robot-delivered frontline service and explores how these will differ in the future.

AB Introduction Immunotherapy is regarded as one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds-urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as noninvasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response.
   Patients and methods In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We carried out an AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a noninvasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and nonresponding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we carried out gene set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients.
   Results The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, P<0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, P=0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (P<0.001), resulting in a 1-year survival difference of 24% (P=0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy.
   Conclusions These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as noninvasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.

AB In recent years, we have witnessed dramatic developments of mobile healthcare robots, which enjoy many advantages over their human counterparts. Previous communication networks for healthcare robots always suffer from high response latency and/or time-consuming computing demands. Robust and high-speed communications and swift processing are critical, sometimes vital in particular in the case of healthcare robots, to the healthcare receivers. As a promising solution, offloading delay-sensitive and communicating-intensive tasks to the robot is expected to improve the services and benefit users. In this paper, we review several state-of-the-art technologies, such as the human-robot interface, environment and user status perceiving, navigation, robust communication and artificial intelligence, of a mobile healthcare robot and discuss in details the customized demands over offloading the computation and communication tasks. According to the intrinsic demands of tasks over the network usage, we categorize abilities of a typical healthcare robot into alternative classes: the edge functionalities and the core functionalities. Many latency-sensitive tasks, such as user interaction, or time-consuming tasks including health receiver status recognition and autonomous moving, can be processed by the robot without frequent communications with data centers. On the other hand, several fundamental abilities, such as radio resource management, mobility management, service provisioning management, need to update the main body with the cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Robustness and safety, in this case, are the primary goals in wireless communications that AI may provide ground-breaking solutions. Based on this partition, this article refers to several state-of-the-art technologies of a mobile healthcare robot and reviews some challenges to be met for its wireless communications.

ID VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; POLYPS
AB Background and Aims: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted polyp detection systems for colonoscopic use are currently attracting attention because they may reduce the possibility of missed adenomas. However, few systems have the necessary regulatory approval for use in clinical practice. We aimed to develop an AI-assisted polyp detection system and to validate its performance using a large colonoscopy video database designed to be publicly accessible.
   Methods: To develop the deep learning-based AI system, 56,668 independent colonoscopy images were obtained from 5 centers for use as training images. To validate the trained AI system, consecutive colonoscopy videos taken at a university hospital between October 2018 and January 2019 were searched to construct a database containing polyps with unbiased variance. All images were annotated by endoscopists according to the presence or absence of polyps and the polyps' locations with bounding boxes.
   Results: A total of 1405 videos acquired during the study period were identified for the validation database, 797 of which contained at least 1 polyp. Of these, 100 videos containing 100 independent polyps and 13 videos negative for polyps were randomly extracted, resulting in 152,560 frames (49,799 positive frames and 102,761 negative frames) for the database. The AI showed 90.5% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity for frame-based analysis. The per-polyp sensitivities for all, diminutive, protruded, and flat polyps were 98.0%, 98.3%, 98.5%, and 97.0%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our trained AI system was validated with a new large publicly accessible colonoscopy database and could identify colorectal lesions with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging paradigm that is driven by recent advancements in vehicular communications and networking. Meanwhile, the capability and intelligence of vehicles are being rapidly enhanced, and this will have the potential of supporting a plethora of new exciting applications that will integrate fully autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the environment. These trends will bring about an era of intelligent IoV, which will heavily depend on communications, computing, and data analytics technologies. To store and process the massive amount of data generated by intelligent IoV, onboard processing and cloud computing will not be sufficient due to resource/power constraints and communication overhead/latency, respectively. By deploying storage and computing resources at the wireless network edge, e.g., radio access points, the edge information system (EIS), including edge caching, edge computing, and edge AI, will play a key role in the future intelligent IoV. EIS will provide not only low-latency content delivery and computation services but also localized data acquisition, aggregation, and processing. This article surveys the latest development in EIS for intelligent IoV. Key design issues, methodologies, and hardware platforms are introduced. In particular, typical use cases for intelligent vehicles are illustrated, including edge-assisted perception, mapping, and localization. In addition, various open-research problems are identified.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape pharmaceutical formulation development through its ability to analyze and continuously monitor large datasets. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional printing (3DP) has made significant advancements in the field of oral drug delivery with personalized drug-loaded formulations being designed, developed and dispensed for the needs of the patient. The FDM 3DP process begins with the production of drug-loaded filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME), followed by the printing of a drug product using a FDM 3D printer. However, the optimization of the fabrication parameters is a time-consuming, empirical trial approach, requiring expert knowledge. Here, M3DISEEN, a web-based pharmaceutical software, was developed to accelerate FDM 3D printing using AI machine learning techniques (MLTs). In total, 614 drug-loaded formulations were designed from a comprehensive list of 145 different pharmaceutical excipients, 3D printed and assessed in-house. To build the predictive tool, a dataset was constructed and models were trained and tested at a ratio of 75:25. Significantly, the AI models predicted key fabrication parameters with accuracies of 76% and 67% for the printability and the filament characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the AI models predicted the HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 8.9 degrees C and 8.3 degrees C, respectively. Strikingly, the AI models achieved high levels of accuracy by solely inputting the pharmaceutical excipient trade names. Therefore, AI provides an effective holistic modeling technology and software to streamline and advance 3DP as a significant technology within drug development. M3DISEEN is available at (http://m3diseen.com/predictions/).

AB Industry 4.0 is an era of smart manufacturing. Manufacturing is impossible without the use of machinery. The majority of these machines comprise rotating components and are called rotating machines. The engineers' top priority is to maintain these critical machines to reduce the unplanned shutdown and increase the useful life of machinery. Predictive maintenance is the current trend of smart maintenance, followed by most maintenance engineers. The challenging task in predictive maintenance is to diagnose the type of fault. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancement, a data-driven approach for predictive maintenance is taking a new flight towards smart manufacturing. Several researchers have published work related to fault diagnosis in rotating machines, mainly exploring a single type of fault. However, a consolidated review of literature that focuses more on the "multi-fault diagnosis"aspect of rotating machines is lacking. There is a need for a study that would systematically cover all the aspects right from sensor selection, data acquisition, feature extraction, multi-sensor data fusion to the systematic review of AI techniques employed in multiple fault diagnosis. In this regard, this paper attempts to achieve the same by implementing a systematic literature review on a Data -driven approach for multi-fault diagnosis of Industrial Rotating Machines using the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis"(PRISMA) method. The PRISMA method is a collection of guidelines for the composition and structure of systematic reviews and other meta-analyses. This paper identifies the foundational work done in the field and gives a comparative study of different aspects related to multi-fault diagnosis of industrial rotating machines. The paper also identifies the major challenges, research gap. It gives solutions using recent advancements in AI in implementing multi-fault diagnosis, giving a strong base for future research in this field.

AB Agriculture farms such as crop, aquaculture and livestock have begun the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in improving their productivity and product quality. However, microalgae farming which requires precise monitoring, controlling and predicting the growth of microalgae biomass has yet to incorporate with IoT and AI technology, as it is still in its infancy phase. Particularly, the cultivation stage of microalgae involves many essential parameters (i.e. biomass concentration, pH, light intensity, temperature and tank level) which require precise monitoring as these parameters are important to ensure an effective biomass productivity in the microalgae farming. Besides, the conventional practices in the current process equipment are still powered by electricity, thus further development by integrating IoT into these processes can ease the production process. Further to that, many researchers has studied the machine learning approach for the identification and classification of microalgae. However, there are still limited studies reported on applying machine learning for the application of microalgae industry such as optimising microalgae cultivation for higher biomass productivity. Therefore, the implementation of IoT and AI in microalgae farming can contribute to the development of the global microalgae industry. The purpose of this current review paper focuses on the overview microalgae biomass production process along with the implementation of IoT toward the future of smart farming. To bridge the gap between the conventional and microalgae smart farming, this paper also highlights the insights on the implementation phases of microalgae smart farming starting from the infant stage that involves the installation and programming of IoT hardware. Then, it is followed by the application of machine learning to predict and auto-optimise the microalgae smart farming process. Furthermore, the process setup and detailed overview of microalgae farming with the integration of IoT have been discussed critically. This review paper would provide a new vision of microalgae farming for microalgae researchers and bioprocessing industries into the digitalisation industrial era.

AB Background: ChatGPT-4 is the latest release of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot able to answer freely formulated and complex questions. In the near future, ChatGPT could become the new standard for health care professionals and patients to access medical information. However, little is known about the quality of medical information provided by the AI.
   Objective: We aimed to assess the reliability of medical information provided by ChatGPT.
   Methods: Medical information provided by ChatGPT-4 on the 5 hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) conditions with the highest global disease burden was measured with the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool. The EQIP tool is used to measure the quality of internet-available information and consists of 36 items that are divided into 3 subsections. In addition, 5 guideline recommendations per analyzed condition were rephrased as questions and input to ChatGPT, and agreement between the guidelines and the AI answer was measured by 2 authors independently. All queries were repeated 3 times to measure the internal consistency of ChatGPT.
   Results: Five conditions were identified (gallstone disease, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The median EQIP score across all conditions was 16 (IQR 14.5-18) for the total of 36 items. Divided by subsection, median scores for content, identification, and structure data were 10 (IQR 9.5-12.5), 1 (IQR 1-1), and 4 (IQR 4-5), respectively. Agreement between guideline recommendations and answers provided by ChatGPT was 60% (15/25). Interrater agreement as measured by the Fleiss kappa was 0.78 (P<.001), indicating substantial agreement. Internal consistency of the answers provided by ChatGPT was 100%.
   Conclusions: ChatGPT provides medical information of comparable quality to available static internet information. Although currently of limited quality, large language models could become the future standard for patients and health care professionals to gather medical information.

AB The technological advances of the past century, marked by the computer revolution and the advent of high-throughput screening technologies in drug discovery, opened the path to the computational analysis and visualization of bioactive molecules. For this purpose, it became necessary to represent molecules in a syntax that would be readable by computers and understandable by scientists of various fields. A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery. This review serves as a guide for researchers who have little experience with the handling of chemical representations and plan to work on applications at the interface of these fields.

AB The study purports to empirically draw out the prominence of eco-innovation in achieving sustainability in business performances, which is further tested by the moderation of turbulent market conditions on the relationship. In contrast to previous eco-innovation research, a nascent methodology involving a dual-stage hybrid analysis and an emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, deep learning was used to analyze 683 viable responses from Ghanaian manufacturing firms.Some intriguing conclusions were discovered where the dimensions of sustainable business performance are achievable vis-`a-vis the implementation of product, process, and organizational eco-innovation. Notably, a manufacturing firm's environmental performance can be considerably improved by implementing the triumvirate of product, process, and organizational eco-innovation. Subsequently, a firm can improve its social performance by R&D investment in eco-innovations, novel green management practices and staff sensitization on eco-innovation. Lastly, market turbulence (technology and environmental turbulence) in the form of technological advancements, intense market competition, changing household demand and taste amplifies the positive effect of product and organizational eco-innovation on the economic dimension of sustainable performance.Theoretically, a newly integrated theoretical framework, which incorporates eco-innovation, contingency and RBV theory, could aid in determining the relative importance of specific determinants, thereby providing significant contributions to eco-innovations effect on the sustainability of business performance.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled analysis of 12-lead ECGs may facilitate efficient estimation of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) risk. However, it remains unclear whether AI provides meaningful and generalizable improvement in predictive accuracy beyond clinical risk factors for AF. Methods: We trained a convolutional neural network (ECG-AI) to infer 5-year incident AF risk using 12-lead ECGs in patients receiving longitudinal primary care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We then fit 3 Cox proportional hazards models, composed of ECG-AI 5-year AF probability, CHARGE-AF clinical risk score (Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology-Atrial Fibrillation), and terms for both ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF (CH-AI), respectively. We assessed model performance by calculating discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration in an internal test set and 2 external test sets (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and UK Biobank). Models were recalibrated to estimate 2-year AF risk in the UK Biobank given limited available follow-up. We used saliency mapping to identify ECG features most influential on ECG-AI risk predictions and assessed correlation between ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors. Results: The training set comprised 45 770 individuals (age 55 +/- 17 years, 53% women, 2171 AF events) and the test sets comprised 83 162 individuals (age 59 +/- 13 years, 56% women, 2424 AF events). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was comparable using CHARGE-AF (MGH, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.767-0.836]; BWH, 0.752 [95% CI, 0.741-0.763]; UK Biobank, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.704-0.759]) and ECG-AI (MGH, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.790-0.856]; BWH, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.736-0.759]; UK Biobank, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.673-0.737]). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest using CH-AI (MGH, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.807 to 0.869]; BWH, 0.777 [95% CI, 0.766 to 0.788]; UK Biobank, 0.746 [95% CI, 0.716 to 0.776]). Calibration error was low using ECG-AI (MGH, 0.0212; BWH, 0.0129; UK Biobank, 0.0035) and CH-AI (MGH, 0.012; BWH, 0.0108; UK Biobank, 0.0001). In saliency analyses, the ECG P-wave had the greatest influence on AI model predictions. ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors were correlated (Pearson r: MGH, 0.61; BWH, 0.66; UK Biobank, 0.41). Conclusions: AI-based analysis of 12-lead ECGs has similar predictive usefulness to a clinical risk factor model for incident AF and the approaches are complementary. ECG-AI may enable efficient quantification of future AF risk.

ID BIG DATA
AB As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in 'lockdown' directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation's economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.

AB Advances in computational algorithms and tools have made the prediction of cancer patient outcomes using computational pathology feasible. However, predicting clinical outcomes from pre-treatment histopathologic images remains a challenging task, limited by the poor understanding of tumor immune micro-environments. In this study, an automatic, accurate, comprehensive, interpretable, and reproducible whole slide image (WSI) feature extraction pipeline known as, IMage-based Pathological REgistration and Segmentation Statistics (IMPRESS), is described. We used both H&E and multiplex IHC (PD-L1, CD8+, and CD163+) images, investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms using automatic feature extraction methods can predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in HER2-positive (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Features are derived from tumor immune micro-environment and clinical data and used to train machine learning models to accurately predict the response to NAC in breast cancer patients (HER2+ AUC = 0.8975; TNBC AUC = 0.7674). The results demonstrate that this method outperforms the results trained from features that were manually generated by pathologists. The developed image features and algorithms were further externally validated by independent cohorts, yielding encouraging results, especially for the HER2+ subtype.

AB Cyber-physical system (CPS) provides a foundation for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) that interconnects all types of devices. The integration of CPS with IIoT generates the large volumes of data forcing the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to extract information more precisely. Nevertheless, the increasing volume/variety of data traffic and the ever-growing number of IIoT devices bring great challenges for the host-centric communication model of the current Internet. In this work, we present a novel information-centric networking (ICN)-based system model in CPS, which enables processing data from IIoT devices closer to the edge as opposed to a content provider. Based on this ICN system model, we propose an edge-assisted authentication scheme in CPS, aiming to protect the system from unauthorized access and reduce workload for resource-constrained devices. The main features of our scheme include a delegation model of security operations and session handshake procedures through edge routers, addressing the rising challenges in managing and securing IIoT devices in the ICN. We formally prove the security of our scheme and conduct performance analysis to show its practicality.

AB In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (Al) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating Al and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of Al, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.

AB Accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) followed by effective rehabilitation is essential for the management of this disorder. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can aid physicians to apply automatic diagnosis and rehabilitation procedures. AI techniques comprise traditional machine learning (ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques. Conventional ML methods employ various feature extraction and classification techniques, but in DL, the process of feature extraction and classification is accomplished intelligently and integrally. DL methods for diagnosis of ASD have been focused on neuroimaging-based approaches. Neuroimaging techniques are non-invasive disease markers potentially useful for ASD diagnosis. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques provide physicians substantial information about the structure (anatomy and structural connectivity) and function (activity and functional connectivity) of the brain. Due to the intricate structure and function of the brain, proposing optimum procedures for ASD diagnosis with neuroimaging data without exploiting powerful AI techniques like DL may be challenging. In this paper, studies conducted with the aid of DL networks to distinguish ASD are investigated. Rehabilitation tools provided for supporting ASD patients utilizing DL networks are also assessed. Finally, we will present important challenges in the automated detection and rehabilitation of ASD and propose some future works.

TI The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or
   generative AI) in healthcare
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.

AB BOTS (SHORT FOR software robots) have been around since the early days of computers. One compelling example of bots is chatbots, algorithms designed to hold a conversation with a human, as envisioned by Alan Turing in the 1950s.(33) The dream of designing a computer algorithm that passes the Turing test has driven artificial intelligence research for decades, as witnessed by initiatives like the Loebner Prize, awarding progress in natural language processing. a Many things have changed since the early days of AI, when bots like Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA,(39) mimicking a Rogerian psychotherapist, were developed as demonstrations or for delight.
   Today, social media ecosystems populated by hundreds of millions of individuals present real incentives-including economic and political ones-

AB Driven by 'success stories' reported by private sector firms, government agencies have also started adopting various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health, taxation, and education); however, extensive research is required in order to exploit the full potential of AI in the public sector, and leverage various AI technologies to address important problems/needs. This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from government agencies' operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel enables 'richer' and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens' interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local government organization), this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios.

AB As a key technology of enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in 5G era, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have quickly attracted widespread attention. However, it is challenging to run computation-intensive DNN-based tasks on mobile devices due to the limited computation resources. What's worse, traditional cloud-assisted DNN inference is heavily hindered by the significant wide-area network latency, leading to poor real-time performance as well as low quality of user experience. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Edgent, a framework that leverages edge computing for DNN collaborative inference through device-edge synergy. Edgent exploits two design knobs: (1) DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions computation between device and edge for purpose of coordinating the powerful cloud resource and the proximal edge resource for real-time DNN inference; (2) DNN right-sizing that further reduces computing latency via early exiting inference at an appropriate intermediate DNN layer. In addition, considering the potential network fluctuation in real-world deployment, Edgent is properly design to specialize for both static and dynamic network environment. Specifically, in a static environment where the bandwidth changes slowly, Edgent derives the best configurations with the assist of regression-based prediction models, while in a dynamic environment where the bandwidth varies dramatically, Edgent generates the best execution plan through the online change point detection algorithm that maps the current bandwidth state to the optimal configuration. We implement Edgent prototype based on the Raspberry Pi and the desktop PC and the extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand low-latency edge intelligence.

AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently witnessed significant advances that have led to multiple successes in solving sequential decision-making problems in various domains, particularly in wireless communications. The next generation of wireless networks is expected to provide scalable, low-latency, ultra-reliable services empowered by the application of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI). The key enabling technologies of future wireless networks, such as intelligent meta-surfaces, aerial networks, and AI at the edge, involve more than one agent which motivates the importance of multi-agent learning techniques. Furthermore, cooperation is central to establishing self-organizing, self-sustaining, and decentralized networks. In this context, this tutorial focuses on the role of DRL with an emphasis on deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for AI-enabled wireless networks. The first part of this paper will present a clear overview of the mathematical frameworks for single-agent RL and MARL. The main idea of this work is to motivate the application of RL beyond the model-free perspective which was extensively adopted in recent years. Thus, we provide a selective description of RL algorithms such as Model-Based RL (MBRL) and cooperative MARL and we highlight their potential applications in future wireless networks. Finally, we overview the state-of-the-art of MARL in fields such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks, and cell-free massive MIMO, and identify promising future research directions. We expect this tutorial to stimulate more research endeavors to build scalable and decentralized systems based on MARL.

AB Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured with radiation therapy. Tumor proximity to critical structures demands accuracy in tumor delineation to avoid toxicities from radiation therapy; however, tumor target contouring for head and neck radiation therapy is labor intensive and highly variable among radiation oncologists.
   Purpose: To construct and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) contouring tool to automate primary gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring in patients with NPC.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, MRI data sets covering the nasopharynx from 1021 patients (median age, 47 years; 751 male, 270 female) with NPC between September 2016 and September 2017 were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 715, 103, and 203 patients, respectively. GTV contours were delineated for 1021 patients and were defined by consensus of two experts. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was applied to 818 training and validation MRI data sets to construct the AI tool, which was tested in 203 independent MRI data sets. Next, the AI tool was compared against eight qualified radiation oncologists in a multicenter evaluation by using a random sample of 20 test MRI examinations. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the difference of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of pre-versus post-AI assistance.
   Results: The AI-generated contours demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth contours at testing in 203 patients (DSC, 0.79; 2.0-mm difference in average surface distance). In multicenter evaluation, AI assistance improved contouring accuracy (five of eight oncologists had a higher median DSC after AI assistance; average median DSC, 0.74 vs 0.78; P < .001), reduced intra-and interobserver variation (by 36.4% and 54.5%, respectively), and reduced contouring time (by 39.4%).
   Conclusion: The AI contouring tool improved primary gross tumor contouring accuracy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have a positive impact on tumor control and patient survival. (C) RSNA, 2019

AB Visual content analysis of tourist photos is an effective way to excavate tourist behavior and explore tourists' cognition in the tourism destination. With the development of computer deep learning and big data mining technology, identifying the content of massive numbers of tourist photos by Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches breaks through the limitations of manual approaches of identifying photos' visual information, e.g. small sample size, complex identification process and results deviation. In this study, 35,356 Flickr tourists' photos in Beijing were identified into 103 scenes by computer deep learning technology. Comparison through statistical analysis for behaviors and perceptions of tourists from different continents and countries was conducted. Tourists' cognitive maps with different perceptual themes were visualized according to photos' geographical information by ArcGIS. The field of how to apply AI technology into tourism destination research was explored and extended by this trial study.

AB Through the digitization of essential functional processes, Industry 4.0 aims to build knowledgeable, networked, and stable value chains. Network trustworthiness is a critical component of network security that is built on positive interactions, guarantees, transparency, and accountability. Blockchain technology has drawn the attention of researchers in various fields of data science as a safe and low-cost platform to track a large number of eventual transactions. Such a technique is adaptable to the renewable energy-trade sector, which suffers from security and trustworthy issues. Having a decentralized energy infrastructure, that is supported by blockchain and artificial intelligence, enables smart and secure microgrid energy trading. The new age of industrial production will be highly versatile in terms of production volume and customization. As such a robust collaboration solution between consumers, businesses, and suppliers must be both secure and sustainable. In this article, we introduce a cooperative and distributed framework that relies on computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities of edge and end devices to enable secure energy trading, remote monitoring, and network trustworthiness. The blockchain and federated learning-enabled solution provide secure energy trading between different critical entities. Such a technique, coupled with 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass surveillance, monitoring, and analysis to occur at the edge. Performance evaluations are conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of reliability and responsiveness in a vehicular network energy-trade scenario.

AB In the last few years, intensive research has been done to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) using optimization techniques. In this paper, we present an extensive review of artificial neural networks (ANNs) based optimization algorithm techniques with some of the famous optimization techniques, e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and backtracking search algorithm (BSA) and some modern developed techniques, e.g., the lightning search algorithm (LSA) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and many more. The entire set of such techniques is classified as algorithms based on a population where the initial population is randomly created. Input parameters are initialized within the specified range, and they can provide optimal solutions. This paper emphasizes enhancing the neural network via optimization algorithms by manipulating its tuned parameters or training parameters to obtain the best structure network pattern to dissolve the problems in the best way. This paper includes some results for improving the ANN performance by PSO, GA, ABC, and BSA optimization techniques, respectively, to search for optimal parameters, e.g., the number of neurons in the hidden layers and learning rate. The obtained neural net is used for solving energy management problems in the virtual power plant system.

   PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
AB The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are being deployed worldwide from 2020 and more capabilities are in the process of being standardized, such as mass connectivity, ultra-reliability, and guaranteed low latency. However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.

AB The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the intemet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.

AB Landslide susceptibility assessment is essential for regional landslide risk assessment and mitigation. Most past studies involved cell-based analysis that takes landslide incidents as geo-spatial points. Nevertheless, given that a landslide is a two-dimensional polygon on maps and a three-dimensional object in the real world, an object-wise assessment is more logical. Fusing with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, this paper proposes a novel AI-powered object-based landslide susceptibility assessment method to address this issue. First, landslide and non-landslide objects are defined based on an optimal object size determined by statistics of historical landslides. Next, landslide and non-landslide samples are constructed by integrating geoenvironmental data layers derived from multi-source data. Subsequently, AI techniques are applied to learn susceptibility prediction based on the prepared samples. To illustrate the proposed method, a comprehensive case study of Hong Kong is conducted, in which six AI algorithms are evaluated including logistic regression (area under curve, AUC = 0.949), random forest (AUC = 0.951), LogitBoost (AUC = 0.958), convolutional neural network (CNN) (AUC = 0.966), bidirectional long short-term memory architecture of recurrent neural network (BiLSTM-RNN) (AUC = 0.966), and CNN-LSTM (AUC = 0.972), among which the BiLSTM-RNN and CNN-LSTM algorithms are applied in landslide susceptibility assessment for the first time. Results confirm that the proposed object-based method outperforms the traditional cell-based method significantly. Equally importantly, the case study produced the first set of AI-based territory-wide landslide susceptibility maps for Hong Kong. These maps can be used as a fundamental tool for quantifying natural terrain landslide risk and identifying susceptible zones where landslide mitigation measures may be needed.

AB The last decade witnessed tremendous developments in social media and e-democracy technologies. A fundamental aspect in these paradigms is that the number of decision makers allowed to partake in a decision making event drastically increases. As a result Large Scale Decision Making (LSDM) has established itself as an emerging and rapidly developing research field, attracting comprehensive studies in the last decade. LSDM events are a complex class of decision making problems, in which multiple and highly diverse stakeholders are involved and the provided alternatives are assessed considering multiple criteria/attributes. Since some of the extant LSDM research was extended from group decision making scenarios, there is no established definition for a LSDM problem as of yet. We firstly propose a clear definition and characterization of LSDM events as a basis for characterizing this emerging family of decision frameworks. Secondly, a classification of LSDM literature is provided. Effectively solving an LSDM problem is usually a complex and challenging process, in which reaching a high consensus or accounting for the agreement or conflict relationships between participants becomes critical. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy and an overview of LSDM models, predicated on their key elements, i.e. the procedures and specific steps followed by the existing models: consensus measurement, subgroup clustering, behavior management, and consensus building mechanisms. Finally, we provide a discussion in which we identify research challenges and propose future research directions under a triple perspective: key LSDM methodologies, AI and data fusion for LSDM, and innovative applications. The potential rise of AI-based LSDM is particularly highlighted in the discussion provided.

AB While the opportunities of ML and AI in healthcare are promising, the growth of complex data-driven prediction models requires careful quality and applicability assessment before they are applied and disseminated in daily practice. This scoping review aimed to identify actionable guidance for those closely involved in AI-based prediction model (AIPM) development, evaluation and implementation including software engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals and to identify potential gaps in this guidance. We performed a scoping review of the relevant literature providing guidance or quality criteria regarding the development, evaluation, and implementation of AIPMs using a comprehensive multi-stage screening strategy. PubMed, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library were searched, and AI experts were consulted. Topics were extracted from the identified literature and summarized across the six phases at the core of this review: (1) data preparation, (2) AIPM development, (3) AIPM validation, (4) software development, (5) AIPM impact assessment, and (6) AIPM implementation into daily healthcare practice. From 2683 unique hits, 72 relevant guidance documents were identified. Substantial guidance was found for data preparation, AIPM development and AIPM validation (phases 1-3), while later phases clearly have received less attention (software development, impact assessment and implementation) in the scientific literature. The six phases of the AIPM development, evaluation and implementation cycle provide a framework for responsible introduction of AI-based prediction models in healthcare. Additional domain and technology specific research may be necessary and more practical experience with implementing AIPMs is needed to support further guidance.

AB Smart cities are aimed to efficiently manage growing urbanization, energy consumption, maintain a green environment, improve the economic and living standards of their citizens, and raise the people's capabilities to efficiently use and adopt the modern information and communication technology (ICT). In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB AlphaFold2 (AF2) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by DeepMind that can predict three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins from amino acid sequences with atomic-level accuracy. Protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology and chemistry, and has puzzled scientists for 50 years. The advent of AF2 presents an unprecedented progress in protein structure prediction and has attracted much attention. Subsequent release of structures of more than 200 million proteins predicted by AF2 further aroused great enthusiasm in the science community, especially in the fields of biology and medicine. AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine. Limitations of current AF2 prediction will also be discussed.

AB Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in wireless infrastructure, real-time collection, and processing of end-user devices is now in high demand. It is now superlative to use AI to detect and predict pandemics of a colossal nature. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in Wuhan China, has had disastrous effects on the global community and has overburdened advanced healthcare systems throughout the world. Globally; over 4,063,525 confirmed cases and 282,244 deaths have been recorded as of 11th May 2020, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control agency. However, the current rapid and exponential rise in the number of patients has necessitated efficient and quick prediction of the possible outcome of an infected patient for appropriate treatment using AI techniques. This paper proposes a fine-tuned Random Forest model boosted by the AdaBoost algorithm. The model uses the COVID-19 patient's geographical, travel, health, and demographic data to predict the severity of the case and the possible outcome, recovery, or death. The model has an accuracy of 94% and a F1 Score of 0.86 on the dataset used. The data analysis reveals a positive correlation between patients' gender and deaths, and also indicates that the majority of patients are aged between 20 and 70 years.

AB Voice shopping is becoming increasingly popular among consumers due to the ubiquitous presence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants in our daily lives. This study explores how personality, trust, privacy concerns, and prior experiences affect customer experience performance perceptions and the combinations of these factors that lead to high customer experience performance. Goldberg?s Big Five Factors of personality, a contextualized theory of reasoned action (TRA-privacy), and recent literature on customer experience are used to develop and propose a conceptual research model. The model was tested using survey data from 224 US-based voice shoppers. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). PLS-SEM revealed that trust and privacy concerns mediate the relationship between personality (agreeableness, emotional instability, and conscientiousness) and voice shoppers? perceptions of customer experience performance. FsQCA reveals the combinations of these factors that lead to high perceptions of customer experience performance. This study contributes to voice shopping literature, which is a relatively understudied area of e-commerce research yet an increasingly popular shopping method.

AB The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources. In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the globe with alarming speed, morbidity, and mortality. Immediate triage of patients with chest infections suspected to be caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed.
   Purpose: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and CT severity scoring systems.
   Materials and Methods: The CO-RADS AI system consists of three deep-learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19, and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who underwent a nonenhanced chest CT examination because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic analysis, linearly weighted kappa values, and classification accuracy.
   Results: A total of 105 patients (mean age, 62 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men) and 262 patients (mean age, 64 years +/- 16; 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and external test sets, respectively. The system discriminated between patients with COVID-19 and those without COVID-19, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.93), for the internal and external test sets, respectively. Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial, with mean linearly weighted k values of 0.60 +/- 0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54 +/- 0.01 for CT severity scores.
   Conclusion: With high diagnostic performance, the CO-RADS AI system correctly identified patients with COVID-19 using chest CT scans and assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores that demonstrated good agreement with findings from eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.

TI GabROP: Gabor Wavelets-Based CAD for Retinopathy of Prematurity
   Diagnosis via Convolutional Neural Networks
SO DIAGNOSTICS

   diagnosis (CAD); artificial intelligence (AI); eye disease; Gabor

AB One of the most serious and dangerous ocular problems in premature infants is retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a proliferative vascular disease. Ophthalmologists can use automatic computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) tools to help them make a safe, accurate, and low-cost diagnosis of ROP. All previous CAD tools for ROP diagnosis use the original fundus images. Unfortunately, learning the discriminative representation from ROP-related fundus images is difficult. Textural analysis techniques, such as Gabor wavelets (GW), can demonstrate significant texture information that can help artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, an effective and automated CAD tool, namely GabROP, based on GW and multiple deep learning (DL) models is proposed. Initially, GabROP analyzes fundus images using GW and generates several sets of GW images. Next, these sets of images are used to train three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models independently. Additionally, the actual fundus pictures are used to build these networks. Using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), texture features retrieved from every CNN trained with various sets of GW images are combined to create a textural-spectral-temporal demonstration. Afterward, for each CNN, these features are concatenated with spatial deep features obtained from the original fundus images. Finally, the previous concatenated features of all three CNN are incorporated using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to lessen the size of features caused by the fusion process. The outcomes of GabROP show that it is accurate and efficient for ophthalmologists. Additionally, the effectiveness of GabROP is compared to recently developed ROP diagnostic techniques. Due to GabROP's superior performance compared to competing tools, ophthalmologists may be able to identify ROP more reliably and precisely, which could result in a reduction in diagnostic effort and examination time.

AB Aims Despite marked progress in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), detecting AF remains difficult and AF-related complications cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality even on optimal current therapy. Methods and results This document summarizes the key outcomes of the 8th AFNET/EHRA Consensus Conference of the Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA). Eighty-three international experts met in Hamburg for 2 days in October 2021. Results of the interdisciplinary, hybrid discussions in breakout groups and the plenary based on recently published and unpublished observations are summarized in this consensus paper to support improved care for patients with AF by guiding prevention, individualized management, and research strategies. The main outcomes are (i) new evidence supports a simple, scalable, and pragmatic population-based AF screening pathway; (ii) rhythm management is evolving from therapy aimed at improving symptoms to an integrated domain in the prevention of AF-related outcomes, especially in patients with recently diagnosed AF; (iii) improved characterization of atrial cardiomyopathy may help to identify patients in need for therapy; (iv) standardized assessment of cognitive function in patients with AF could lead to improvement in patient outcomes; and (v) artificial intelligence (AI) can support all of the above aims, but requires advanced interdisciplinary knowledge and collaboration as well as a better medico-legal framework. Conclusions Implementation of new evidence-based approaches to AF screening and rhythm management can improve outcomes in patients with AF. Additional benefits are possible with further efforts to identify and target atrial cardiomyopathy and cognitive impairment, which can be facilitated by AI.

AB center dot PURPOSE: To optimize artificial intelligence (AI) algo-rithms to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomogra-phy and biomechanics to enhance ectasia detection.center dot DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional case-control ret-rospective study.center dot METHODS: A total of 3886 unoperated eyes from 3412 patients had Pentacam and Corvis ST (Oculus Op-tikgerate GmbH) examinations. The database included 1 eye randomly selected from 1680 normal patients (N) and from 1181 "bilateral" keratoconus (KC) patients, along with 551 normal topography eyes from patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE-NT), and their 474 unoperated ectatic (VAE-E) eyes. The current TBIv1 (tomographic-biomechanical index) was tested, and an optimized AI algorithm was developed for augmenting accuracy.center dot RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating char-acteristic curve (AUC) of the TBIv1 for discriminating clinical ectasia (KC and VAE-E) was 0.999 (98.5% sen-sitivity; 98.6% specificity [cutoff: 0.5]), and for VAE-NT, 0.899 (76% sensitivity; 89.1% specificity [cutoff: 0.29]). A novel random forest algorithm (TBIv2), devel-oped with 18 features in 156 trees using 10-fold cross -validation, had a significantly higher AUC (0.945; De -Long, P < .0001) for detecting VAE-NT (84.4% sen-sitivity and 90.1% specificity; cutoff: 0.43; DeLong, P < .0001) and a similar AUC for clinical ectasia (0.999; DeLong, P = .818; 98.7% sensitivity; 99.2% specificity [cutoff: 0.8]). Considering all cases, the TBIv2 had a higher AUC (0.985) than TBIv1 (0.974; DeLong, P < .0001).center dot CONCLUSIONS: AI optimization to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biome-chanical assessments augments accuracy for ectasia detection, characterizing ectasia susceptibility in the diverse VAE-NT group. Some patients with VAE may have true unilateral ectasia. Machine learning consider-ing additional data, including epithelial thickness or other parameters from multimodal refractive imaging, will con-tinuously enhance accuracy.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a transformative technology that is advancing pharmaceutical research by producing personalized drug products. However, advances made via 3DP have been slow due to the lengthy trialand-error approach in optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that could revolutionize pharmaceutical 3DP through analyzing large datasets. Herein, literature-mined data for developing AI machine learning (ML) models was used to predict key aspects of the 3DP formulation pipeline and in vitro dissolution properties. A total of 968 formulations were mined and assessed from 114 articles. The ML techniques explored were able to learn and provide accuracies as high as 93% for values in the filament hot melt extrusion process. In addition, ML algorithms were able to use data from the composition of the formulations with additional input features to predict the drug release of 3D printed medicines. The best prediction was obtained by an artificial neural network that was able to predict drug release times of a formulation with a mean error of +/- 24.29 min. In addition, the most important variables were revealed, which could be leveraged in formulation development. Thus, it was concluded that ML proved to be a suitable approach to modelling the 3D printing workflow.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly popular and useful for modeling landslide movement processes due to its advantages of providing excellent generalization ability and accurately describing complex and nonlinear behavior. However, the identification of key variables is a crucial step in ensuring robustness and accuracy in AI modeling, but thus far, little attention has been given to this topic. In the present study, mutual information (MI)-based measures are proposed for input variable selection (IVS) and incorporated into optimized support vector regression (SVR) for the displacement prediction of seepage-driven landslides. The performance of optimized SVR models with ten MI-based IVS strategies is compared. A typical seepage-driven landslide was chosen for comparison. The experimental results indicate that IVS-based optimized SVR can significantly improve predictions. When the variable-reduced inputs were input into the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC)-SVR model, the mean values of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) decreased and increased by as much as 71.6 and 95.2%, respectively, relative to those for the base model with all candidates. Furthermore, the joint mutual information (JMI) and double input symmetrical relevance (DISR) criteria are recommended for IVS for seepage-driven landslides because they achieve the best tradeoff between accuracy and stability.

AB Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.

AB Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated continuous improvement in smart city based applications such as smart healthcare, transportation, and environmental management. Digital Twin (DT) is an AI-based virtual replica of the real-world physical entity. DTs have been successfully adopted in manufacturing and industrial sectors, they are however still at the early stage in smart city based applications. The major reason for this lag is the lack of trust and privacy issues in sharing sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is a technology that could be integrated along with DT to ensure privacy preservation and trustworthiness. This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications. We present an extensive survey on the various smart city based applications of FL models in DTs. Based on the study, some prominent challenges and future directions are presented for better FL-DT integration in future applications.

DE Hierarchical blockchain; federated learning; knowledge sharing
ID IOT; MECHANISM
AB Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is highly characterized by collaborative environment data sensing, computing and processing. Emerging big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies show significant advantages and efficiency for knowledge sharing among intelligent vehicles. However, it is challenging to guarantee the security and privacy of knowledge during the sharing process. Moreover, conventional AI-based algorithms cannot work properly in distributed vehicular networks. In this paper, a hierarchical blockchain framework and a hierarchical federated learning algorithm are proposed for knowledge sharing, by which vehicles learn environmental data through machine learning methods and share the learning knowledge with each others. The proposed hierarchical blockchain framework is feasible for the large scale vehicular networks. The hierarchical federated learning algorithm is designed to meet the distributed pattern and privacy requirement of IoVs. Knowledge sharing is then modeled as a trading market process to stimulate sharing behaviours, and the trading process is formulated as a multi-leader and multi-player game. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical algorithm can improve the sharing efficiency and learning quality. Furthermore, the blockchain-enabled framework is able to deal with certain malicious attacks effectively.

AB With the tremendous revival of artificial intelligence, predictive maintenance (PdM) based on data-driven methods has become the most effective solution to address smart manufacturing and industrial big data, especially for performing health perception (e.g., fault diagnosis and remaining life assessment). Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research. Finally, we summarize the common features regarding our surveyed PdM applications and discuss several potential directions.

AB Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI), previously considered black box approaches, are becoming more interpretable, as a result of the recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI). In particular, local interpretation methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) offer the opportunity to flexibly model, interpret and visualise complex geographical phenomena and processes. In this paper, we use SHAP to interpret XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) as an example to demonstrate how to extract spatial effects from machine learning models. We conduct simulation experiments that compare SHAP-explained XGBoost to Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) at the parameter level. Results show that XGBoost estimates similar spatial effects as those in SLM and MGWR models. An empirical example of Chicago ridehailing modelling is presented to demonstrate the utility of SHAP with real datasets. Examples and evidence in this paper suggest that locally interpreted machine learning models are good alternatives to spatial statistical models and perform better when complex spatial and non-spatial effects (e.g. non-linearities, interactions) coexist and are unknown.

AB Personalized orders bring challenges to the production paradigm, and there is an urgent need for the dynamic responsiveness and self-adjustment ability of the workshop. Traditional dispatching rules and heuristic algo-rithms solve the production planning and control problems by making schedules. However, the previous methods cannot work well in a changeable workshop environment when encountering a large number of stochastic disturbances of orders and resources. Recently, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in solving the dynamic scheduling problem has attracted researchers' attention. Therefore, this paper presents a multi -agent manufacturing system based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which integrates the self -organization mechanism and self-learning strategy. Firstly, the manufacturing equipment in the workshop is constructed as an equipment agent with the support of edge computing node, and an improved contract network protocol (CNP) is applied to guide the cooperation and competition among multiple agents, so as to complete personalized orders efficiently. Secondly, a multi-layer perceptron is employed to establish the decision-making module called AI scheduler inside the equipment agent. According to the perceived workshop state information, AI scheduler intelligently generates an optimal production strategy to perform task allocation. Then, based on the collected sample trajectories of scheduling process, AI scheduler is periodically trained and updated through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to improve its decision-making performance. Finally, in the multi -agent manufacturing system testbed, dynamic events such as stochastic job insertions and unpredictable machine failures are considered in the verification experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of obtaining the scheduling solutions that meet various performance metrics, as well as dealing with resource or task disturbances efficiently and autonomously.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. Over this period, the economic and healthcare consequences of COVID-19 infection in survivors of acute COVID-19 infection have become apparent. During the course of the pandemic, computer analysis of medical images and data have been widely used by the medical research com-munity. In particular, deep-learning methods, which are artificial intelligence (AI)-based ap-proaches, have been frequently employed. This paper provides a review of deep-learning -based AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest radiography and computed tomog-raphy. Thirty papers published from February 2020 to March 2022 that used two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) deep convolutional neural networks combined with transfer learning for COVID-19 detection were reviewed. The review describes how deep-learning methods detect COVID-19, and several limitations of the proposed methods are highlighted.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB This study develops and validates a scale of Social Service Robot Interaction Trust (SSRIT) that measures consumers' trust toward interaction with AI social robots in service delivery. Through a systematic literature review, semi-structured interviews, a focus group study, and rigorous quantitative studies, this study conceptualizes the interaction-based trust and proposes a third-order reflective-formative scale, which suggests that trust in interaction is measured by 3 s-order indicators: propensity to trust in robot, trustworthy robot function and design, and trustworthy service task and context. Propensity to trust in robot is predicted by familiarity, robot use self efficacy, social influence, technology attachment, and trust stance in technology. Trustworthy robot function and design is formed by anthropomorphism, robot performance, and effort expectancy. Trustworthy service task and context is determined by perceived service risk, robot-service fit, and facilitating robot-use condition. The convergent, discriminant, external, concurrent, and predictive validities of the scale are validated. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are provided.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies into healthcare is transforming patient-practitioner interaction and could offer an additional platform for patient education and support. Objectives This study investigated whether ChatGPT-4 could provide safe and up-to-date medical information about breast augmentation that is comparable to other patient information sources. Methods ChatGPT-4 was asked to generate 6 commonly asked questions regarding breast augmentation and respond to them. Its responses were qualitatively evaluated by a panel of specialist plastic and reconstructive surgeons and reconciled with a literature search of 2 large medical databases for accuracy, informativeness, and accessibility. Results ChatGPT-4 provided well-structured, grammatically accurate, and comprehensive responses to the questions posed; however, it was limited in providing personalized advice and sometimes generated inappropriate or outdated references. ChatGPT consistently encouraged engagement with a specialist for specific information. Conclusions Although ChatGPT-4 showed promise as an adjunct tool in patient education regarding breast augmentation, there are areas requiring improvement. Additional advancements and software engineering are needed to enhance the reliability and applicability of AI-driven chatbots in patient education and support systems.

AB Background In general, academic but not community endoscopists have demonstrated adequate endoscopic differentiation accuracy to make the 'resect and discard' paradigm for diminutive colorectal polyps workable. Computer analysis of video could potentially eliminate the obstacle of interobserver variability in endoscopic polyp interpretation and enable widespread acceptance of 'resect and discard'.
   Study design and methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for real-time assessment of endoscopic video images of colorectal polyps. A deep convolutional neural network model was used. Only narrow band imaging video frames were used, split equally between relevant multiclasses. Unaltered videos from routine exams not specifically designed or adapted for AI classification were used to train and validate the model. The model was tested on a separate series of 125 videos of consecutively encountered diminutive polyps that were proven to be adenomas or hyperplastic polyps.
   Results T he AI model works with a confidence mechanism and did not generate sufficient confidence to predict the histology of 19 polyps in the test set, representing 15% of the polyps. For the remaining 106 diminutive polyps, the accuracy of the model was 94% (95% CI 86% to 97%), the sensitivity for identification of adenomas was 98% (95% CI 92% to 100%), specificity was 83% (95% CI 67% to 93%), negative predictive value 97% and positive predictive value 90%.
   Conclusions A n AI model trained on endoscopic video can differentiate diminutive adenomas from hyperplastic polyps with high accuracy. Additional study of this programme in a live patient clinical trial setting to address resect and discard is planned.

AB Machine learning (ML) has become the most successful branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It provides a unique opportunity to make structural engineering more predictable due to its ability in handling complex nonlinear structural systems under extreme actions. Currently, there is a boom in implementing ML in structural engi-neering, especially over the last five years thanks to recent advances in ML techniques and computational ca-pabilities as well as the availability of large datasets. This paper provides an ambitious and comprehensive review on the growing applications of ML algorithms for structural engineering. An overview of ML techniques for structural engineering is presented with a particular focus on basic ML concepts, ML libraries, open-source Python codes, and structural engineering datasets. The review covers a wide range of structural engineering applications of ML including: (1) structural analysis and design, (2) structural health monitoring and damage detection, (3) fire resistance of structures; (4) resistance of structural members under various actions, and (5) mechanical properties and mix design of concrete. Both isolated members and whole systems made from steel, concrete and composite materials are explored. Findings from the reviewed literature, challenges and future commendations are highlighted and discussed. With available databases and ML codes provided, this review paper serves as a useful reference for structural engineering practitioners and researchers who are not familiar with ML but wish to enter this field of research.

AB The increasing energy prices and pollutants from fossil fuels that threaten the climate, there is a growing preference for renewable energy. The implementation of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) has been a challenging task due to its interference, uncertainty, and unpredictable nature. Also, it comes with high net present cost and multi-dimensional architecture facets. It is critical to evaluate HRES using a variety of economic and sizing criteria. This paper aims to provide a succinct review of recent progress in the field of optimization of different HRES using various optimization techniques based on classical methods, artificial intelligence (AI), hybrid algorithms, and software-based optimization tools. While comparing classical and AI-based techniques, the AI-based techniques are found promising and provide a global solution in less time. However, there are deficiencies in AI-based techniques. To overcome those, a combination of two or more algorithms, known as hybrid optimization algorithm can be adopted to solve problems more quickly, reliably, and effectively. Apart from different algorithms, there are several popular optimization software tools. Among them, the HOMER software tool is one of the most popular as it is simple to use. As the research activities in the optimization of HRES are increasing, the concentration on sources such as hydro, geothermal, biomass, and biofuel has to be given due consideration. This analysis will inform readers about the current and evolving state of optimization approaches for HRES applications and enable them to choose the most appropriate strategy as per requirement.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; CMOS; ACCELERATOR; MACRO
AB Realizing increasingly complex artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities directly on edge devices calls for unprecedented energy efficiency of edge hardware. Compute-in-memory (CIM) based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM)(1) promises to meet such demand by storing AI model weights in dense, analogue and non-volatile RRAM devices, and by performing AI computation directly within RRAM, thus eliminating power-hungry data movement between separate compute and memory(2-5). Although recent studies have demonstrated in-memory matrix-vector multiplication on fully integrated RRAM-CIM hardware(6-17), it remains a goal for a RRAM-CIM chip to simultaneously deliver high energy efficiency, versatility to support diverse models and software-comparable accuracy. Although efficiency, versatility and accuracy are all indispensable for broad adoption of the technology, the inter-related trade-offs among them cannot be addressed by isolated improvements on any single abstraction level of the design. Here, by co-optimizing across all hierarchies of the design from algorithms and architecture to circuits and devices, we present NeuRRAM-a RRAM-based CIM chip that simultaneously delivers versatility in reconfiguring CIM cores for diverse model architectures, energy efficiency that is two-times better than previous state-of-the-art RRAM-CIM chips across various computational bit-precisions, and inference accuracy comparable to software models quantized to four-bit weights across various AI tasks, including accuracy of 99.0 percent on MNIST18 and 85.7 percent on CIFAR-10(19) image classification, 84.7-percent accuracy on Google speech command recognition(20), and a 70-percent reduction in image-reconstruction error on a Bayesian image-recovery task.

AB Automated container terminal (ACT) is considered as port industry development direction, and accurate kinematic data (speed, volume, etc.) is essential for enhancing ACT operation efficiency and safety. Port surveillance videos provide much useful spatial-temporal information with advantages of easy obtainable, large spatial coverage, etc. In that way, it is of great importance to analyze automated guided vehicle (AGV) trajectory movement from port surveillance videos. Motivated by the newly emerging computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we propose an ensemble framework for extracting vehicle speeds from port-like surveillance videos for the purpose of analyzing AGV moving trajectory. Firstly, the framework exploits vehicle position in each image via a feature-enhanced scale-aware descriptor. Secondly, we match vehicle position and trajectory data from the previous step output via Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm, and thus we obtain the vehicular imaging trajectory in a frame-by-frame manner. Thirdly, we estimate the vehicular moving speed in real-world via the help of perspective projection theory. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework can obtain accurate vehicle kinematic data under typical port traffic scenarios considering that the average measurement error of root mean square deviation is 0.675 km/h, the mean absolute deviation is 0.542 km/h, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9349. The research findings suggest that cutting-edge AI and computer vision techniques can accurately extract on-site vehicular trajectory related data from port videos, and thus help port traffic participants make more reasonable management decisions.

TI Expanding Cosmetic Plastic Surgery Research With ChatGPT
SO AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: In the past 3 months, OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory, has released ChatGPT, a conversation large language model. ChatGPT has the ability to answer user questions, admit to mistakes, and learn from users that are accessing the program.
   Objectives: Due to the importance of producing evidence-based research in plastic surgery, the authors of this study wanted to determine how accurate ChatGPT could be in creating novel systematic review ideas that encompass the diverse practice of cosmetic surgery.
   Methods: ChatGPT was given commands to produce 20 novel systematic review ideas for 12 different topics within cosmetic surgery. For each topic, the system was told to give 10 general and 10 specific ideas that were related to the concept. To determine the accuracy of ChatGPT, a literature review was conducted with PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane.
   Results: A total of 240 "novel" systematic review ideas were constructed by ChatGPT. We determined that the system had an overall accuracy of 55%. When topics were stratified by general and specific ideas, we found that ChatGPT was 35% accurate for general ideas and 75% accurate for specific ideas.
   Conclusions: ChatGPT is an excellent tool that should be utilized by plastic surgeons. ChatGPT is versatile and has uses beyond research, including patient consultation, patient support, and marketing. As advancements in AI continue to be made, it is important for plastic surgeons to consider the utilization of AI in their clinical practice.

TI Federated learning for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with
   COVID-19
SO NATURE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIVACY; CHALLENGES; MODELS
AB Federated learning (FL) is a method used for training artificial intelligence models with data from multiple sources while maintaining data anonymity, thus removing many barriers to data sharing. Here we used data from 20 institutes across the globe to train a FL model, called EXAM (electronic medical record (EMR) chest X-ray AI model), that predicts the future oxygen requirements of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 using inputs of vital signs, laboratory data and chest X-rays. EXAM achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) >0.92 for predicting outcomes at 24 and 72 h from the time of initial presentation to the emergency room, and it provided 16% improvement in average AUC measured across all participating sites and an average increase in generalizability of 38% when compared with models trained at a single site using that site's data. For prediction of mechanical ventilation treatment or death at 24 h at the largest independent test site, EXAM achieved a sensitivity of 0.950 and specificity of 0.882. In this study, FL facilitated rapid data science collaboration without data exchange and generated a model that generalized across heterogeneous, unharmonized datasets for prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, setting the stage for the broader use of FL in healthcare.
   Federated learning, a method for training artificial intelligence algorithms that protects data privacy, was used to predict future oxygen requirements of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 using data from 20 different institutes across the globe.

AB Technology-enhanced language learning has exerted positive effects on the performance and engagement of L2 learners. Since the advent of tools based on recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), educators have made major strides in applying state-of-the-art technologies to writing classrooms. In November 2022, an AI-powered chatbot named ChatGPT capable of automatic text generation was introduced to the public. The study tried to apply ChatGPT's text generation feature in a one-week L2 writing practicum. The study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate students' behaviors and reflections in their exposure to ChatGPT in writing classrooms. The developmental features in learning activities and reflective perceptions were triangulated for the piloting evaluation of the impact of ChatGPT on L2 writing learners. The findings revealed the affordance and potential applicability of the tool in L2 writing pedagogy. Additionally, the tool also showcased an automatic workflow that could maximize the efficiency in composing writing. However, participants generally expressed their concern with its threats to academic honesty and educational equity. The study impelled the reconceptualization of plagiarism in the new era, development of regulatory policies and pedagogical guidance to regulate proper utilization of the tool. Being a pioneering effort, the study accentuated future research directions for more insights into the application of ChatGPT in L2 learning, and the establishment of corresponding pedagogical adjustments.

AB Radiomics is a relatively new word for the field of radiology, meaning the extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with Al because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiornics and Al have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances inn computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and Al; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.

AB Early cancer detection has significant clinical value, but there remains no single method that can comprehensively identify multiple types of early-stage cancer. Here, we report the diagnostic accuracy of simultaneous detection of 6 types of early-stage cancers (lung, breast, colon, liver, pancreas, and stomach) by analyzing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy profiles of exosomes using artificial intelligence in a retrospective study design. It includes classification models that recognize signal patterns of plasma exosomes to identify both their presence and tissues of origin. Using 520 test samples, our system identified cancer presence with an area under the curve value of 0.970. Moreover, the system classified the tumor organ type of 278 early-stage cancer patients with a mean area under the curve of 0.945. The final integrated decision model showed a sensitivity of 90.2% at a specificity of 94.4% while predicting the tumor organ of 72% of positive patients. Since our method utilizes a non-specific analysis of Raman signatures, its diagnostic scope could potentially be expanded to include other diseases.
   Early detection of multiple cancers through a single method could be clinically important. Here the authors report the diagnostic performance for early detection for multiple cancers using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) profiles of exosomes from a single blood test and artificial intelligence in a retrospective study design.

AB While adopting chatbots powered by artificial intelligence could enhance knowledge sharing, it also causes challenges due to the "dark side " of these agents. However, research on the factors influencing chatbots for knowledge sharing is lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed the integrated chatbot acceptance-avoidance model, which looks at the positive and negative determinants of using chatbots for knowledge sharing. Through a comprehensive questionnaire survey of 447 students, the research model is evaluated using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a symmetric approach, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) as an asymmetric approach. The PLS-SEM results supported the positive role of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and habit and the negative role of perceived threats in affecting chatbot use for knowledge sharing. Although PLS-SEM results revealed that social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation have no impact on chatbot use, the fsQCA analysis revealed that all factors might play a role in shaping the use of chatbots. In addition to the theoretical contributions, the findings provide several managerial implications for universities, instructors, and chatbot developers to help them make insightful decisions and promote the use of chatbots.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) accommodates a huge number of heterogeneous devices to bring vast services under a distributed computing scenarios. Most productive services in IIoT are closely related to production control and require distributed network support with low delay. However, the resource reservation based on gross traffic prediction ignores the importance of productive services and treats them as ordinary services, so it is difficult to provide stable low delay support for large amounts of productive service requests. For many productions, unexpected communication delays are unacceptable, and the delay may lead to serious production accidents causing great losses, especially when the productive service is security related. In this article, we propose a brain-like productive service provisioning scheme with federated learning (BrainIoT) for IIoT. The BrainIoT scheme is composed of three algorithms, including industrial knowledge graph-based relation mining, federated learning-based service prediction, and globally optimized resource reservation. BrainIoT combines production information into network optimization, and utilizes the interfactory and intrafactory relations to enhance the accuracy of service prediction. The globally optimized resource reservation algorithm suitably reserves resources for predicted services considering various resources. The numerical results show that the BrainIoT scheme utilizes interfactory relation and intrafactory relation to make an accurate service prediction, which achieves 96% accuracy, and improves the quality of service.

AB Importance ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that has significant societal implications. Training curricula using AI are being developed in medicine, and the performance of chatbots in ophthalmology has not been characterized.Objective To assess the performance of ChatGPT in answering practice questions for board certification in ophthalmology.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study used a consecutive sample of text-based multiple-choice questions provided by the OphthoQuestions practice question bank for board certification examination preparation. Of 166 available multiple-choice questions, 125 (75%) were text-based.Exposures ChatGPT answered questions from January 9 to 16, 2023, and on February 17, 2023.Main Outcomes and Measures Our primary outcome was the number of board certification examination practice questions that ChatGPT answered correctly. Our secondary outcomes were the proportion of questions for which ChatGPT provided additional explanations, the mean length of questions and responses provided by ChatGPT, the performance of ChatGPT in answering questions without multiple-choice options, and changes in performance over time.Results In January 2023, ChatGPT correctly answered 58 of 125 questions (46%). ChatGPT's performance was the best in the category general medicine (11/14; 79%) and poorest in retina and vitreous (0%). The proportion of questions for which ChatGPT provided additional explanations was similar between questions answered correctly and incorrectly (difference, 5.82%; 95% CI, -11.0% to 22.0%; ?(2)(1) = 0.45; P = .51). The mean length of questions was similar between questions answered correctly and incorrectly (difference, 21.4 characters; SE, 36.8; 95% CI, -51.4 to 94.3; t = 0.58; df = 123; P = .22). The mean length of responses was similar between questions answered correctly and incorrectly (difference, -80.0 characters; SE, 65.4; 95% CI, -209.5 to 49.5; t = -1.22; df = 123; P = .22). ChatGPT selected the same multiple-choice response as the most common answer provided by ophthalmology trainees on OphthoQuestions 44% of the time. In February 2023, ChatGPT provided a correct response to 73 of 125 multiple-choice questions (58%) and 42 of 78 stand-alone questions (54%) without multiple-choice options.Conclusions and Relevance ChatGPT answered approximately half of questions correctly in the OphthoQuestions free trial for ophthalmic board certification preparation. Medical professionals and trainees should appreciate the advances of AI in medicine while acknowledging that ChatGPT as used in this investigation did not answer sufficient multiple-choice questions correctly for it to provide substantial assistance in preparing for board certification at this time.

AB Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.

AB Digitization and automation have always had an immense impact on healthcare. It embraces every new and advanced technology. Recently the world has witnessed the prominence of the metaverse which is an emerging technology in digital space. The metaverse has huge potential to provide a plethora of health services seamlessly to patients and medical professionals with an immersive experience. This paper proposes the amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain in the metaverse to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience. Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, namely the doctor's environment, the patient's environment, and the metaverse environment. The doctors and patients interact in a metaverse environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data. The metaverse environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by avatars in the metaverse environment. All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data, i.e., images, speech, text, videos, clinical data, etc., will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain. These data are used for disease prediction and diagnosis by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models. The GradCAM and LIME approaches of XAI provide logical reasoning for the prediction of diseases and ensure trust, explainability, interpretability, and transparency regarding the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Blockchain technology provides data security for patients while enabling transparency, traceability, and immutability regarding their data. These features of blockchain ensure trust among the patients regarding their data. Consequently, this proposed architecture ensures transparency and trust regarding both the diagnosis of diseases and the data security of the patient. We also explored the building block technologies of the metaverse. Furthermore, we also investigated the advantages and challenges of a metaverse in healthcare.

   DESIGN
AB Determining the amount of void fraction of multiphase flows in pipelines of the oil, chemical and petrochemical industries is one of the most important challenges. Performance of capacitance based two phase flow meters highly depends on the fluid properties. Fluctuation of the liquid phase properties such as density, due to temperature and pressure changes, would cause massive errors in determination of the void fraction. A common approach to fix this problem is periodic recalibration of the system, which is a tedious task. The aim of this study is proposing a method based on artificial intelligence (AI), which offers the advantage of intelligent measuring of the void fraction regardless of the liquid phase changes without the need for recalibration. To train AI, a data set for different liquid phases is required. Although it is possible to obtain the required data from experiments, it is time-consuming and also incorporates its own specific safety laboratory consideration, particularly working with flammable liquids such as gasoline, oil and gasoil. So, COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to model a homogenous regime of two-phase flow with five different liquid phases and void fractions. To validate the simulation geometry, initially an experimental setup including a concave sensor to measure the capacitance by LCR meter for the case that water used as the liquid phase, was established. After validation of the simulated geometry for concave sensor, a ring sensor was also simulated to investigate the best sensor type. It was found that the concave type has a better sensitivity. Therefore, the concave type was used to measure the capacitance for different liquid phases and void fractions inside the pipe. Finally, simulated data were used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model in MATLAB software. The trained MLP model was able to predict the void fraction independent of the liquid phase density changes with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.74.

AB Electronic skin (E-skin) based on tactile sensors plays an important role in monitoring daily health status and artificial intelligence (AI). High sensitivity and flexibility are highly demanded to simulate human skins. In this work, a flexible TENG, based on wrinkled PDMS/MXene composite films prepared by facile ultraviolet ozone (UVO) irradiation, was constructed as self-powered tactile sensor. The best sensitivity reaches 0.18 V/Pa during 10-80 Pa and 0.06 V/Pa during 80-800 Pa, respectively, higher than most of the other self-powered tactile sensors. The different sensitivity under low pressure and high pressure is related to wrinkles, illustrated by a simulation using COMSOL software combined with theory analysis. Our tactile sensors show good application prospects in monitoring complicated human physiological signal and imitating human touch sensation.

Integrating theories about the power of visual communication and the role played by uncertainty in undermining trust in public discourse, we explain the likely contribution of deepfakes to online disinformation. Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare people's evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on social media. We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward generalized indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying recent challenges to online civic culture in democratic societies.

AB The synthesis of complex organic molecules requires several stages, from ideation to execution, that require time and effort investment from expert chemists. Here, we report a step toward a paradigm of chemical synthesis that relieves chemists from routine tasks, combining artificial intelligence-driven synthesis planning and a robotically controlled experimental platform. Synthetic routes are proposed through generalization of millions of published chemical reactions and validated in silico to maximize their likelihood of success. Additional implementation details are determined by expert chemists and recorded in reusable recipe files, which are executed by a modular continuous-flow platform that is automatically reconfigured by a robotic arm to set up the required unit operations and carry out the reaction. This strategy for computer-augmented chemical synthesis is demonstrated for 15 drug or drug-like substances.

AB Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is closely associated with the occurrence, development, progression and prognosis of cancer, and aberrant m6A regulators have been identified as novel anticancer drug targets. Both traditional medicine-related approaches and modern drug discovery platforms have been used in an attempt to develop m6A-targeted drugs. Here, we provide an update of the latest findings on m6A modification and the critical roles of m6A modification in cancer progression, and we summarize rational sources for the discovery of m6A-targeted anticancer agents from traditional medicines and computer-based chemosynthetic compounds. This review highlights the potential agents targeting m6A modification for cancer treatment and proposes the advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) in the discovery of m6A-targeting anticancer drugs.

AB The two fields of machine learning and graphical causality arose and are developed separately. However, there is, now, cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In this article, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, that is, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.

AB Within seismology, geology, civil and structural engineering, deep learning (DL), especially via generative adversarial networks (GANs), represents an innovative, engaging, and advantageous way to generate reliable synthetic data that represent actual samples' characteristics, providing a handy data augmentation tool. Indeed, in many practical applications, obtaining a significant number of high-quality information is demanding. Data augmentation is generally based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning data-driven models. The DL GAN-based data augmentation approach for generating synthetic seismic signals revolutionized the current data augmentation paradigm. This study delivers a critical state-of-art review, explaining recent research into AI-based GAN synthetic generation of ground motion signals or seismic events, and also with a comprehensive insight into seismic-related geophysical studies. This study may be relevant, especially for the earth and planetary science, geology and seismology, oil and gas exploration, and on the other hand for assessing the seismic response of buildings and infrastructures, seismic detection tasks, and general structural and civil engineering applications. Furthermore, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the current studies on adversarial learning applied to seismology may help to guide research efforts in the next future toward the most promising directions.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Data collection is a major bottleneck in machine learning and an active research topic in multiple communities. There are largely two reasons data collection has recently become a critical issue. First, as machine learning is becoming more widely-used, we are seeing new applications that do not necessarily have enough labeled data. Second, unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning techniques automatically generate features, which saves feature engineering costs, but in return may require larger amounts of labeled data. Interestingly, recent research in data collection comes not only from the machine learning, natural language, and computer vision communities, but also from the data management community due to the importance of handling large amounts of data. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of data collection from a data management point of view. Data collection largely consists of data acquisition, data labeling, and improvement of existing data or models. We provide a research landscape of these operations, provide guidelines on which technique to use when, and identify interesting research challenges. The integration of machine learning and data management for data collection is part of a larger trend of Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration and opens many opportunities for new research.

AB Artificial Intelligent (AI) In-home Voice Assistants have seen unprecedented growth. However, we have little understanding on the factors motivating individuals to use such devices. Given the unique characteristics of the technology, in the main hands free, controlled by voice, and the presentation of a voice user interface, the current technology adoption models are not comprehensive enough to explain the adoption of this new technology. Focusing on voice interactions, this research combines the theoretical foundations of U&GT with technology theories to gain a clearer understanding on the motivations for adopting and using in-home voice assistants. This research presents a conceptual model on the use of voice controlled technology and an empirical validation of the model through the use of Structural Equation Modelling with a sample of 724 in-home voice assistant users. The findings illustrate that individuals are motivated by the (1) utilitarian benefits, (2) symbolic benefits and (3) social benefits provided by voice assistants, the results found that hedonic benefits only motivate the use of in-home voice assistants in smaller households. Additionally, the research establishes a moderating role of perceived privacy risks in dampening and negatively influencing the use of in-home voice assistants.

AB With the advent of big data era, deep learning (DL) has become an essential research subject in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). DL algorithms are characterized with powerful feature learning and expression capabilities compared with the traditional machine learning (ML) methods, which attracts worldwide researchers from different fields to its increasingly wide applications. Furthermore, in the field of geochnical engineering, DL has been widely adopted in various research topics, a comprehensive review summarizing its application is desirable. Consequently, this study presented the state of practice of DL in geotechnical engineering, and depicted the statistical trend of the published papers. Four major algorithms, including feedforward neural (FNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) along with their geotechnical applications were elaborated. In addition, a thorough summary containing pubilished literatures, the corresponding reference cases, the adopted DL algorithms as well as the related geotechnical topics was compiled. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives of future development of DL in geotechnical engineering were presented and discussed.

AB The human sense of touch is essential for dexterous tool usage, spatial awareness, and social communication. Equipping intelligent human-like androids and prosthetics with electronic skins-a large array of sensors spatially distributed and capable of rapid somatosensory perception-will enable them to work collaboratively and naturally with humans to manipulate objects in unstructured living environments. Previously reported tactile-sensitive electronic skins largely transmit the tactile information from sensors serially, resulting in readout latency bottlenecks and complex wiring as the number of sensors increases. Here, we introduce the Asynchronously Coded Electronic Skin (ACES)-a neuromimetic architecture that enables simultaneous transmission of thermotactile information while maintaining exceptionally low readout latencies, even with array sizes beyond 10,000 sensors. We demonstrate prototype arrays of up to 240 artificial mechanoreceptors that transmitted events asynchronously at a constant latency of 1 ms while maintaining an ultra-high temporal precision of <60 ns, thus resolving fine spatiotemporal features necessary for rapid tactile perception. Our platform requires only a single electrical conductor for signal propagation, realizing sensor arrays that are dynamically reconfigurable and robust to damage. We anticipate that the ACES platform can be integrated with a wide range of skin-like sensors for artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced autonomous robots, neuroprosthetics, and neuromorphic computing hardware for dexterous object manipulation and somatosensory perception.

AB Floods are natural hazards that lead to devastating financial losses and large displacements of people. Flood susceptibility maps can improve mitigation measures according to the specific conditions of a study area. The design of flood susceptibility maps has been enhanced through use of hybrid machine learning and deep learning models. Although these models have achieved better accuracy than traditional models, they are not widely used by stakeholders due to their black-box nature. In this study, we propose the application of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that incorporates the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model to interpret the outcomes of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models, and analyze the impact of variables on flood susceptibility mapping. This study was conducted in Jinju Province, South Korea, which has a long history of flood events. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which showed a prediction accuracy of 88.4%. SHAP plots showed that land use and various soil attributes significantly affected flood susceptibility in the study area. In light of these findings, we recommend the use of XAIbased models in future flood susceptibility mapping studies to improve interpretations of model outcomes, and build trust among stakeholders during the flood-related decision-making process.

TI Al recognition of patient race in medical imaging: a modelling study
SO LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH

AB Background Previous studies in medical imaging have shown disparate abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect a person's race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical imaging that would be obvious to human experts when interpreting the images. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of AI to recognise a patient's racial identity from medical images.
   Methods Using private (Emory CXR, Emory Chest CT, Emory Cervical Spine, and Emory Mammogram) and public (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT, and Digital Hand Atlas) datasets, we evaluated, first, performance quantification of deep learning models in detecting race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalise to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities. Second, we assessed possible confounding of anatomic and phenotypic population features by assessing the ability of these hypothesised confounders to detect race in isolation using regression models, and by re-evaluating the deep learning models by testing them on datasets stratified by these hypothesised confounding variables. Last, by exploring the effect of image corruptions on model performance, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognise race.
   Findings In our study, we show that standard AI deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities, which was sustained under external validation conditions (x-ray imaging [area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0.91-0-99], CT chest imaging [0.87-0-96], and mammography [0.81]). We also showed that this detection is not due to proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race (eg, performance of possible confounders: body-mass index [AUC 0.55], disease distribution [0.61], and breast density [0.61]). Finally, we provide evidence to show that the ability of AI deep learning models persisted over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrums of the images, suggesting the efforts to control this behaviour when it is undesirable will be challenging and demand further study.
   Interpretation The results from our study emphasise that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging.

AB Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.

ID WOMEN; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREDICTION
AB PURPOSE Accurate risk assessment is essential for the success of population screening programs in breast cancer. Models with high sensitivity and specificity would enable programs to target more elaborate screening efforts to high-risk populations, while minimizing overtreatment for the rest. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models have demonstrated a significant advance over risk models used today in clinical practice. However, the responsible deployment of novel AI requires careful validation across diverse populations. To this end, we validate our AI-based model, Mirai, across globally diverse screening populations.
   METHODS We collected screening mammograms and pathology-confirmed breast cancer outcomes from Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Novant, USA; Emory, USA; Maccabi-Assuta, Israel; Karolinska, Sweden; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan; and Barretos, Brazil. We evaluated Uno's concordance index for Mirai in predicting risk of breast cancer at one to five years from the mammogram.
   RESULTS A total of 128,793 mammograms from 62,185 patients were collected across the seven sites, of which 3,815 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Mirai obtained concordance indices of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.81), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.83), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Novant, Emory, Maccabi-Assuta, Karolinska, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Barretos, respectively.
   CONCLUSION Mirai, a mammography-based risk model, maintained its accuracy across globally diverse test sets from seven hospitals across five countries. This is the broadest validation to date of an AI-based breast cancer model and suggests that the technology can offer broad and equitable improvements in care.

ID FUTURE; SERVICE; DESIGN; CPS
AB State-of-the-art technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing (CC), big data analytics (BDA), and artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly stimulated the development of smart manufacturing. An important prerequisite for smart manufacturing is cyber-physical integration, which is increasingly being embraced by manufacturers. As the preferred means of such integration, cyber-physical systems (CPS) and digital twins (DTs) have gained extensive attention from researchers and practitioners in industry. With feedback loops in which physical processes affect cyber parts and vice versa, CPS and DTs can endow manufacturing systems with greater efficiency, resilience, and intelligence. CPS and DTs share the same essential concepts of an intensive cyber-physical connection, real-time interaction, organization integration, and in-depth collaboration. However, CPS and DTs are not identical from many perspectives, including their origin, development, engineering practices, cyber-physical mapping, and core elements. In order to highlight the differences and correlation between them, this paper reviews and analyzes CPS and DTs from multiple perspectives. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

AB Artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning are dominant sources to use in order to make a system smarter. Nowadays, the smart speech emotion recognition (SER) system is a basic necessity and an emerging research area of digital audio signal processing. However, SER plays an important role with many applications that are related to human-computer interactions (HCI). The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation. The ConvLSTM layers are adopted for input-to-state and state-to-state transition in order to extract the spatial cues by utilizing the convolution operations. We placed four LFLBs in order to extract the spatiotemporal cues in the hierarchical correlational form speech signals using the residual learning strategy. Furthermore, we utilized a novel sequence learning strategy in order to extract the global information and adaptively adjust the relevant global feature weights according to the correlation of the input features. Finally, we used the center loss function with the softmax loss in order to produce the probability of the classes. The center loss increases the final classification results and ensures an accurate prediction as well as shows a conspicuous role in the whole proposed SER scheme. We tested the proposed system over two standard, interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) and ryerson audio visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) speech corpora, and obtained a 75% and an 80% recognition rate, respectively.

AB The unprecedented outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, termed as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has placed numerous governments around the world in a precarious position. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak.

AB The use of black box algorithms in medicine has raised scholarly concerns due to their opaqueness and lack of trustworthiness. Concerns about potential bias, accountability and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect epistemic concerns with normative issues. In this paper, we outline that black box algorithms are less problematic for epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always necessary, and by explaining that computational processes are indeed methodologically opaque to humans, we argue that the reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting the outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we explain how computational reliabilism, which does not require transparency and supports the reliability of algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI are to be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns remain with black box algorithms, even when the results are trustworthy. Having justified knowledge from reliable indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that deliberation about the results of reliable algorithms is required to find out what is a desirable action. Thus understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss the use of black box algorithms altogether but should inform the way in which these algorithms are designed and implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire the necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical informatics and data scientists, black box algorithms can contribute to improving medical care.

AB Visual morphology assessment is routinely used for evaluating of embryo quality and selecting human blastocysts for transfer after in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, the assessment produces different results between embryologists and as a result, the success rate of IVF remains low. To overcome uncertainties in embryo quality, multiple embryos are often implanted resulting in undesired multiple pregnancies and complications. Unlike in other imaging fields, human embryology and IVF have not yet leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) for unbiased, automated embryo assessment. We postulated that an AI approach trained on thousands of embryos can reliably predict embryo quality without human intervention. We implemented an AI approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to select highest quality embryos using a large collection of human embryo time-lapse images (about 50,000 images) from a high-volume fertility center in the United States. We developed a framework (STORK) based on Google's Inception model. STORK predicts blastocyst quality with an AUC of >0.98 and generalizes well to images from other clinks outside the US and outperforms individual embryologists. Using clinical data for 2182 embryos, we created a decision tree to integrate embryo quality and patient age to identify scenarios associated with pregnancy likelihood. Our analysis shows that the chance of pregnancy based on individual embryos varies from 13.8% (age >= 41 and poor-quality) to 66.3% (age <37 and good-quality) depending on automated blastocyst quality assessment and patient age. In conclusion, our Al-driven approach provides a reproducible way to assess embryo quality and uncovers new, potentially personalized strategies to select embryos.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances toward the goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic codesigns, being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the tradeoffs between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation trends and opportunities.

AB The traditional fashion industry is heavily dependent on designers whose talent and vision have a significant impact on their innovative designs. Through taking advantage of recent advances in image-to-image translation by generative adversarial networks (GANs), marked improvement in designers' efficiency is now possible. Considering both randomness and controllability in the design process, this article presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for fashion design. Under this framework, a sketch-generation module which is based on latent space is firstly introduced for designing various sketches. Secondly, a rendering-generation module is proposed to learn mapping between textures and sketches to complete the task of fashion design. In order to achieve effectiveness in synthesizing semantic-aware textures on sketches, a multi-conditional feature interaction module is developed in the rendering-generation model. Moreover, two different training schemes are introduced to optimize both the sketch-generation module and the rendering-generation module. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed models, we built a large-scale dataset which consists of 115,584 pairs of fashion item images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and indicate that our model can facilitate designers' design process by taking full advantage of the controllability of different conditions (e.g., sketch and texture) and the randomness of latent space.

AB Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has caused many death cases and affected all sectors of human life. With gradual progression of time, COVID-19 was declared by the world health organization (WHO) as an outbreak, which has imposed a heavy burden on almost all countries, especially ones with weaker health systems and ones with slow responses. In the field of healthcare, deep learning has been implemented in many applications, e.g., diabetic retinopathy detection, lung nodule classification, fetal localization, and thyroid diagnosis. Numerous sources of medical images (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI) make deep learning a great technique to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Motivated by this fact, a large number of research works have been proposed and developed for the initial months of 2020. In this paper, we first focus on summarizing the state-of-the-art research works related to deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Then, we provide an overview of deep learning and its applications to healthcare found in the last decade. Next, three use cases in China, Korea, and Canada are also presented to show deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Finally, we discuss several challenges and issues related to deep learning implementations for COVID-19 medical image processing, which are expected to drive further studies in controlling the outbreak and controlling the crisis, which results in smart healthy cities.

AB As a powerful tool, the vehicular network has been built to connect human communication and transportation around the world for many years to come. However, with the rapid growth of vehicles, the vehicular network becomes heterogeneous, dynamic, and large scaled, which makes it difficult to meet the strict requirements, such as ultralow latency, high reliability, high security, and massive connections of the next-generation (6G) network. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique to make both the vehicle and wireless communication highly efficient and adaptable. Naturally, employing ML into vehicular communication and network becomes a hot topic and is being widely studied in both academia and industry, paving the way for the future intelligentization in 6G vehicular networks. In this article, we provide a survey on various ML techniques applied to communication, networking, and security parts in vehicular networks and envision the ways of enabling AI toward a future 6G vehicular network, including the evolution of intelligent radio (IR), network intelligentization, and self-learning with proactive exploration.

AB The Metaverse allows the integration of physical and digital versions of users, processes, and environments where entities communicate, transact, and socialize. With the shift towards Extended Reality (XR) technologies, the Metaverse is envisioned to support a wide range of applicative verticals. It will support a seamless mix of physical and virtual worlds (realities) and, thus, will be a game changer for the Future Internet, built on the Semantic Web framework. The Metaverse will be ably assisted by the convergence of emerging wireless communication networks (such as Fifth-Generation and Beyond networks) or Sixth-Generation (6G) networks, Blockchain (BC), Web 3.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It has the potential for convergence in diverse industrial applications such as digital twins, telehealth care, connected vehicles, virtual education, social networks, and financial applications. Recent studies on the Metaverse have focused on explaining its key components, but a systematic study of the Metaverse in terms of industrial applications has not yet been performed. Owing to this gap, this survey presents the salient features and assistive Metaverse technologies. We discuss a high-level and generic Metaverse framework for modern industrial cyberspace and discuss the potential challenges and future directions of the Metaverse's realization. A case study on Metaverse-assisted Real Estate Management (REM) is presented, where the Metaverse governs a Buyer-Broker-Seller (BBS) architecture for land registrations. We discuss the performance evaluation of the current land registration ecosystem in terms of cost evaluation, trust probability, and mining cost on the BC network. The obtained results show the viability of the Metaverse in REM setups.

AB Comprehensive analyses of transport phenomena and thermodynamics of complex multiphysics systems are laborious and computationally intensive. Yet, such analyses are often required during the design of thermal and process equipment. As a remedy, this paper puts forward a novel approach to the prediction of transport behaviours of multiphysics systems, offering significant reductions in the computational time and cost. This is based on machine learning techniques that utilize the data generated by computational fluid dynamics for training purposes. The physical system under investigation includes a stagnation-point flow of a hybrid nanofluid (Cu-Al2O3/Water) over a blunt object embedded in porous media. The problem further involves mixed convection, entropy generation, local thermal non-equilibrium and non-linear thermal radiation within the porous medium. The SVR (Support Machine Vector) model is employed to approximate velocity, temperature, Nusselt number and shear-stress as well as entropy generation and Bejan number functions. Further, PSO meta-heuristic algorithm is applied to propose correlations for Nusselt number and shear stress. The effects of Nusselt number, temperature fields and shear stress on the surface of the blunt-body as well as thermal and frictional entropy generation are analysed over a wide range of parameters. Further, it is shown that the generated correlations allow a quantitative evaluation of the contribution of a large number of variables to Nusselt number and shear stress. This makes the combined computational and artificial intelligence (AI) approach most suitable for design purposes. (C) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Uncertainty estimation in healthcare involves quantifying and understanding the inherent uncertainty or variability associated with medical predictions, diagnoses, and treatment outcomes. In this era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, uncertainty estimation becomes vital to ensure safe decision-making in the medical field. Therefore, this review focuses on the application of uncertainty techniques to machine and deep learning models in healthcare. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our analysis revealed that Bayesian methods were the predominant technique for uncertainty quantification in machine learning models, with Fuzzy systems being the second most used approach. Regarding deep learning models, Bayesian methods emerged as the most prevalent approach, finding application in nearly all aspects of medical imaging. Most of the studies reported in this paper focused on medical images, highlighting the prevalent application of uncertainty quantification techniques using deep learning models compared to machine learning models. Interestingly, we observed a scarcity of studies applying uncertainty quantification to physiological signals. Thus, future research on uncertainty quantification should prioritize investigating the application of these techniques to physiological signals. Overall, our review highlights the significance of integrating uncertainty techniques in healthcare applications of machine learning and deep learning models. This can provide valuable insights and practical solutions to manage uncertainty in real-world medical data, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of medical diagnoses and treatment recommendations.

AB Objective:We sought to assess the performance of the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) tool in elderly emergency surgery (ES) patients. Summary Background Data:The POTTER tool was derived using a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-methodology called optimal classification trees and validated for prediction of ES outcomes. POTTER outperforms all existent risk-prediction models and is available as an interactive smartphone application. Predicting outcomes in elderly patients has been historically challenging and POTTER has not yet been tested in this population. Methods:All patients >= 65 years who underwent ES in the ACS-NSQIP 2017 database were included. POTTER's performance for 30-day mortality and 18 postoperative complications (eg, respiratory or renal failure) was assessed using c-statistic methodology, with planned sub-analyses for patients 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years. Results:A total of 29,366 patients were included, with mean age 77, 55.8% females, and 62% who underwent emergency general surgery. POTTER predicted mortality accurately in all patients over 65 (c-statistic 0.80). Its best performance was in patients 65 to 74 years (c-statistic 0.84), and its worst in patients >= 85 years (c-statistic 0.71). POTTER had the best discrimination for predicting septic shock (c-statistic 0.90), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for >= 48 hours (c-statistic 0.86), and acute renal failure (c-statistic 0.85). Conclusions:POTTER is a novel, interpretable, and highly accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality in elderly ES patients up to age 85 years. POTTER could prove useful for bedside counseling and for benchmarking of ES care.

AB Railway communications has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries due to the booming development of railways, especially high-speed railways (HSRs). To be in line with the vision of future smart rail communications, the rail transport industry needs to develop innovative communication network architectures and key technologies that ensure high-quality transmissions for both passengers and railway operations and control systems. Under high mobility and with safety, eco-friendliness, comfort, transparency, predictability, and reliability. Fifth-generation (5G) technologies could be a promising solution to dealing with the design challenges on high reliability and high throughput for HSR communications. Based on our in-depth analysis of smart rail traffic services and communication scenarios, we propose a network slicing architecture for a 5G-based HSR system. With a ray tracing-based analysis of radio wave propagation characteristics and channel models for millimeter wave (mmWave) bands in railway scenarios, we draw important conclusions with regard to appropriate operating frequency bands for HSRs. mymargin Specifically, we have identified significant 5G-based key technologies for HSRs, such as spatial modulation, fast channel estimation, cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), mmWave, efficient beamforming, wireless backhaul, ultrareliable low latency communications, and enhanced handover strategies. Based on these technologies, we have developed a complete framework of 5G technologies for smart railways and pointed out exciting future research directions.

AB Since its renaissance, deep learning (DL) has been widely used in various medical imaging tasks and has achieved remarkable success in many medical imaging applications, thereby propelling us into the so-called artificial intelligence (AI) era. It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high-performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront DL approaches. In this survey article, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in DL are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and so on. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.

AB Since greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater scarcity are the top global risks, looking for new methods to reduce CO2 emissions and increase drinking water production is becoming a significant civilization challenge. One of the promising approaches to addressing these dares has proven to be adsorption cooling and desalination systems powered with low-grade thermal energy, including waste heat of the near ambient temperature.Due to poor heat and mass transfer and the low performance of the existing adsorption chiller with conven-tional packed beds, the innovative concept of fluidized beds application was elaborated on in the paper. Furthermore, the article introduces a novel approach based on artificial intelligence methods for predicting heat and mass transfer within the adsorption bed of cooling and desalination systems.Silica gel, as the parent adsorption material, and two additives, aluminium and carbon nanotubes, with different shares, are applied in tests. The water vapour uptake and the convective heat transfer coefficient, measured during experiments and predicted by the developed models, are investigated and compared. The data evaluated by models are in good agreement with experimental results. The developed models allow the study of input parameters' effect on the outputs and optimize the operating strategy of the bed. The highest water vapour uptake and the convective heat transfer coefficient, which can be obtained for the considered range of input parameters, are equal to 1.65 g/g and 1212.62 W/m2 K, respectively, and can be achieved only due to the fluidization of the adsorption bed.

AB Technologies are changing at a rapid pace and in unpredictable ways. The scale of their impact is also far-reaching. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics, digital platforms, social media, blockchain, and 3-D printing affect many parts of the organization simultaneously, enabling new interdependencies within and between units and with actors that many organizations have typically considered to be outside their boundaries. Consequently, today's emerging technologies have the potential to fundamentally shape all aspects of organizing. This article introduces the special issue "Emerging Technologies and Organizing." We treat these new technologies as "emerging" because their uses and effects are still varied and have yet to stabilize around a recognizable set of patterns and because the technologies themselves are, by design, always changing and adapting. To theorize the relationship between emerging technologies and organizing, we draw on relational thinking in philosophy and sociology to develop a relational perspective on emerging technologies. Our goal in doing so is to create a new way for organizational scholars to incorporate the ever-increasing role of technology in their theorizing of key organizational processes and phenomena. By developing a relational perspective that treats emerging technologies not as stable entities, but as a set of evolving relations, we provide a novel way for organizational scholars to account for the role of technology in their topics of interest. We sketch the outlines of this relational perspective on emerging technologies and discuss the implications it has for what organizational scholars study and how we study it.

TI AI enabled sign language recognition and VR space bidirectional

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

AB Sign language recognition, especially the sentence recognition, is of great significance for lowering the communication barrier between the hearing/speech impaired and the non-signers. The general glove solutions, which are employed to detect motions of our dexterous hands, only achieve recognizing discrete single gestures (i.e., numbers, letters, or words) instead of sentences, far from satisfying the meet of the signers' daily communication. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence enabled sign language recognition and communication system comprising sensing gloves, deep learning block, and virtual reality interface. Non-segmentation and segmentation assisted deep learning model achieves the recognition of 50 words and 20 sentences. Significantly, the segmentation approach splits entire sentence signals into word units. Then the deep learning model recognizes all word elements and reversely reconstructs and recognizes sentences. Furthermore, new/never-seen sentences created by new-order word elements recombination can be recognized with an average correct rate of 86.67%. Finally, the sign language recognition results are projected into virtual space and translated into text and audio, allowing the remote and bidirectional communication between signers and non-signers.
   Though wearable gloves are widely used for gesture associated applications (e.g. sign language recognition), sentence identification of sign language remains a challenge. Here, the authors report AI-enabled recognition system helps barrier-free communication between signers and non-signers.

ID CHATGPT
AB This review explains how large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are developed and discusses their strengths and limitations in the context of potential clinical applications.
   Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern about their use in healthcare settings. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare for the benefit of patients and practitioners.

AB ChatGPT is an AI tool that has sparked debates about its potential implications for education. We used the SWOT analysis framework to outline ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses and to discuss its opportunities for and threats to education. The strengths include using a sophisticated natural language model to generate plausible answers, self-improving capability, and providing personalised and real-time responses. As such, ChatGPT can increase access to information, facilitate personalised and complex learning, and decrease teaching workload, thereby making key processes and tasks more efficient. The weaknesses are a lack of deep understanding, difficulty in evaluating the quality of responses, a risk of bias and discrimination, and a lack of higher-order thinking skills. Threats to education include a lack of understanding of the context, threatening academic integrity, perpetuating discrimination in education, democratising plagiarism, and declining high-order cognitive skills. We provide agenda for educational practice and research in times of ChatGPT.

As a large language model (LLM), the software was able to process inquiries by users and generate text based on compiled datasets in a humanist manner. Due to the importance of research in the Plastic Surgery community, we set out to determine if ChatGPT could be utilized to produce novel systematic review ideas relevant to Plastic Surgery. Out of 80 systematic review ideas generated by ChatGPT, we found that the software was highly accurate in creating novel systematic review ideas. Beyond aiding in Plastic Surgery research, ChatGPT has the potential to be used for virtual consultations, pre-operative planning, patient education, and post-operative care for patients. ChatGPT may be a simple solution for the complex problems encountered in Plastic Surgery. & COPY; 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

ID DESIGN
AB As an emerging distributed machine learning (ML) method, federated learning (FL) can protect data privacy through collaborative learning of artificial intelligence (AI) models across a large number of devices. However, inefficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks have slowed FL performance. Therefore, a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning (BAFL) framework is proposed to ensure the security and efficiency required by FL. The blockchain ensures that the model data cannot be tampered with while asynchronous learning speeds up global aggregation. A novel entropy weight method is used to evaluate the participating rank and proportion of the local model trained in BAFL of the devices. The energy consumption and local model update efficiency are balanced by adjusting the local training and communication delay and optimizing the block generation rate. The extensive evaluation results show that the proposed BAFL framework has higher efficiency and higher performance for preventing poisoning attacks than other distributed ML methods.

ID NETWORKS
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is poised to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and represents a step toward building autonomous systems with a higher-level understanding of the visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning (RL) to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. DRL algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.

AB Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), also known as mesenchymal stem cells, have been intensely investigated for clinical applications within the last decades. However, the majority of registered clinical trials applying MSC therapy for diverse human diseases have fallen short of expectations, despite the encouraging pre-clinical outcomes in varied animal disease models. This can be attributable to inconsistent criteria for MSCs identity across studies and their inherited heterogeneity. Nowadays, with the emergence of advanced biological techniques and substantial improvements in bio-engineered materials, strategies have been developed to overcome clinical challenges in MSC application. Here in this review, we will discuss the major challenges of MSC therapies in clinical application, the factors impacting the diversity of MSCs, the potential approaches that modify MSC products with the highest therapeutic potential, and finally the usage of MSCs for COVID-19 pandemic disease.

AB Histopathological classification of gastric and colonic epithelial tumours is one of the routine pathological diagnosis tasks for pathologists. Computational pathology techniques based on Artificial intelligence (AI) would be of high benefit in easing the ever increasing workloads on pathologists, especially in regions that have shortages in access to pathological diagnosis services. In this study, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on biopsy histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs) of stomach and colon. The models were trained to classify WSI into adenocarcinoma, adenoma, and non-neoplastic. We evaluated our models on three independent test sets each, achieving area under the curves (AUCs) up to 0.97 and 0.99 for gastric adenocarcinoma and adenoma, respectively, and 0.96 and 0.99 for colonic adenocarcinoma and adenoma respectively. The results demonstrate the generalisation ability of our models and the high promising potential of deployment in a practical histopathological diagnostic workflow system.

ID HETEROGENEITY
AB Radiomics aims to quantify phenotypic characteristics on medical imaging through the use of automated algorithms. Radiomic artificial intelligence (AI) technology, either based on engineered hard-coded algorithms or deep learning methods, can be used to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers. However, lack of standardized algorithm definitions and image processing severely hampers reproducibility and comparability of results. To address this issue, we developed PyRadiomics, a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D Slicer. Here, we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and demonstrate its application in characterizing lung lesions. Source code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at www.radiomics.io. With this platform, we aim to establish a reference standard for radiomic analyses, provide a tested and maintained resource, and to grow the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.

AB Globally, there is a substantial unmet need to diagnose various diseases effectively. The complexity of the different disease mechanisms and underlying symptoms of the patient population presents massive challenges in developing the early diagnosis tool and effective treatment. Machine learning (ML), an area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables researchers, physicians, and patients to solve some of these issues. Based on relevant research, this review explains how machine learning (ML) is being used to help in the early identification of numerous diseases. Initially, a bibliometric analysis of the publication is carried out using data from the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases. The bibliometric study of 1216 publications was undertaken to determine the most prolific authors, nations, organizations, and most cited articles. The review then summarizes the most recent trends and approaches in machine-learning-based disease diagnosis (MLBDD), considering the following factors: algorithm, disease types, data type, application, and evaluation metrics. Finally, in this paper, we highlight key results and provides insight into future trends and opportunities in the MLBDD area.

TI Learning from simulation: An end-to-end deep-learning approach for
   computational ghost imaging
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) for computational imaging usually require to experimentally collect a large set of labeled data to train a neural network. Here we demonstrate that a practically usable neural network for computational imaging can be trained by using simulation data. We take computational ghost imaging (CGI) as an example to demonstrate this method. We develop a one-step end-to-end neural network, trained with simulation data, to reconstruct two-dimensional images directly from experimentally acquired one-dimensional bucket signals, without the need of the sequence of illumination patterns. This is in particular useful for image transmission through quasi-static scattering media as little care is needed to take to simulate the scattering process when generating the training data. We believe that the concept of training using simulation data can be used in various DL-based solvers for general computational imaging.

AB Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings' energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R-2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings' energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R-2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R-2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB In accordance with guidelines, most patients with T1 colorectal cancers (CRC) undergo surgical resection with lymph node dissection, despite the low incidence (similar to 10%) of metastasis to lymph nodes. To reduce unnecessary surgical resections, we used artificial intelligence to build a model to identify T1 colorectal tumors at risk for metastasis to lymph node and validated the model in a separate set of patients. METHODS: We collected data from 3134 patients with T1 CRC treated at 6 hospitals in Japan from April 1997 through September 2017 ( training cohort). We developed a machine-learning artificial neural network (ANN) using data on patients' age and sex, as well as tumor size, location, morphology, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and histologic grade. We then conducted the external validation on the ANN model using independent 939 patients at another hospital during the same period (validation cohort). We calculated areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves (AUCs) for the ability of the model and US guidelines to identify patients with lymph node metastases. RESULTS: Lymph node metastases were found in 319 (10.2%) of 3134 patients in the training cohort and 79 (8.4%) of /939 patients in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.83, whereas the guidelines identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.73 (P <.001). When the analysis was limited to patients with initial endoscopic resection (n = 517), the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.84 and the guidelines identified these patients with an AUC of 0.77 (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying patients with T1 CRCs who had lymph node metastases. This model might be used to determine which patients require additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 CRCs. UMIN Clinical Trials Registry no: UMIN000038609

AB Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have successfully provided automated solutions to numerous real-world problems. Healthcare is one of the most important research areas for ML researchers, with the aim of developing automated disease prediction systems. One of the disease detection problems that AI and ML researchers have focused on is dementia detection using ML methods. Numerous automated diagnostic systems based on ML techniques for early prediction of dementia have been proposed in the literature. Few systematic literature reviews (SLR) have been conducted for dementia prediction based on ML techniques in the past. However, these SLR focused on a single type of data modality for the detection of dementia. Hence, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ML-based automated diagnostic systems considering different types of data modalities such as images, clinical-features, and voice data. We collected the research articles from 2011 to 2022 using the keywords dementia, machine learning, feature selection, data modalities, and automated diagnostic systems. The selected articles were critically analyzed and discussed. It was observed that image data driven ML models yields promising results in terms of dementia prediction compared to other data modalities, i.e., clinical feature-based data and voice data. Furthermore, this SLR highlighted the limitations of the previously proposed automated methods for dementia and presented future directions to overcome these limitations.

AB Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7: 1: 2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs. Findings We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8.4%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), sensitivity of 79.0% (77.5-80.4), specificity of 79.5% (79.0-79.9), F1 score of 39.2% (38.1-40.3), and overall accuracy of 79.4% (79.0-79.9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.90-0.91), sensitivity to 82.3% (80.9-83.6), specificity to 83.4% (83.0-83.8), F1 score to 45.4% (44.2-46.5), and overall accuracy to 83.3% (83.0-83.7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In past decades, the industrial and technological developments have increased exponentially and accompanied by non-judicial and un-sustainable utilization of non-renewable resources. At the same time, the environmental branch of toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique (ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min of duration respectively. The experimental outcome highlights the optimal performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model over the recent techniques.

ID LOCALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION
AB It is known that an ultrawideband (UWB)-based indoor positioning system (IPS) has superior positioning performance and can meet the requirements of location-based services (LBSs) as the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, there is a limitation of UWB positioning when it is conducted at the nonline-of-sight (NLOS) channels degrading the UWB ranging accuracy at indoor environments. In this article, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) applied UWB positioning system that can enhance the positioning performance by classifying channel conditions with channel impulse response (CIR) of the received UWB signal. The proposed system mitigates the positioning degradation caused by the NLOS situations by performing extended Kalman filter (EKF) localization and long short-term memory (LSTM) training of the observed channel status. The main feature of the proposed UWB positioning method is that it can be used even at unknown locations not trained with the LSTM model learning the channel status, because of our training strategy of not the position coordinates, but the UWB ranging error between UWB devices corresponding to CIR of the received UWB signal. This article provides the experimental setup and performance evaluation results of the proposed system. The evaluation results showed that the proposed AI-applied UWB positioning method significantly improved its accuracy performance compared with the existing positioning methods.

AB One of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is climate action (SDG-13), and wildfire is among the catastrophic events that both impact climate change and are aggravated by it. In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world's forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.

TI Combining the strengths of radiologists and AI for breast cancer
   screening: a retrospective analysis
SO LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MAMMOGRAPHY
AB Background We propose a decision-referral approach for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the breast-cancer screening pathway, whereby the algorithm makes predictions on the basis of its quantification of uncertainty. Algorithmic assessments with high certainty are done automatically, whereas assessments with lower certainty are referred to the radiologist. This two-part AI system can triage normal mammography exams and provide post-hoc cancer detection to maintain a high degree of sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of this AI system on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original radiologist decision.
   Methods We used a retrospective dataset consisting of 1 193 197 full-field, digital mammography studies carried out between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2020, from eight screening sites participating in the German national breast-cancer screening programme. We derived an internal-test dataset from six screening sites (1670 screen-detected cancers and 19 997 normal mammography exams), and an external-test dataset of breast cancer screening exams (2793 screen-detected cancers and 80 058 normal exams) from two additional screening sites to evaluate the performance of an AI algorithm on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original individual radiologist decision at the point-of-screen reading ahead of the consensus conference. Different configurations of the AI algorithm were evaluated. To account for the enrichment of the datasets caused by oversampling cancer cases, weights were applied to reflect the actual distribution of study types in the screening programme. Triaging performance was evaluated as the rate of exams correctly identified as normal. Sensitivity across clinically relevant subgroups, screening sites, and device manufacturers was compared between standalone AI, the radiologist, and decision referral. We present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC (AUROC) to evaluate AI-system performance over its entire operating range. Comparison with radiologists and subgroup analysis was based on sensitivity and specificity at clinically relevant configurations.
   Findings The exemplary configuration of the AI system in standalone mode achieved a sensitivity of 84.2% (95% CI 82.4-85.8) and a specificity of 89.5% (89.0-89.9) on internal-test data, and a sensitivity of 84.6% (83.3-85.9) and a specificity of 91.3% (91.1-91.5) on external-test data, but was less accurate than the average unaided radiologist. By contrast, the simulated decision-referral approach significantly improved upon radiologist sensitivity by 2.6 percentage points and specificity by 1.0 percentage points, corresponding to a triaging performance at 63.0% on the external dataset; the AUROC was 0.982 (95% CI 0.978-0.986) on the subset of studies assessed by AI, surpassing radiologist performance. The decision-referral approach also yielded significant increases in sensitivity for a number of clinically relevant subgroups, including subgroups of small lesion sizes and invasive carcinomas. Sensitivity of the decision-referral approach was consistent across the eight included screening sites and three device manufacturers.
   Interpretation The decision-referral approach leverages the strengths of both the radiologist and AI, demonstrating improvements in sensitivity and specificity surpassing that of the individual radiologist and of the standalone AI system. This approach has the potential to improve the screening accuracy of radiologists, is adaptive to the requirements of screening, and could allow for the reduction of workload ahead of the consensus conference, without discarding the generalised knowledge of radiologists.

ID NUMERICAL TREATMENT; NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) knacks are exploited broadly by the research community in the field of engineering and technology to enhance efficacy of the outputs for rapid development of business and society. Therefore, it looks promising to explore or investigate in the novel AI-based integrated numerical computing to study the solution dynamic of computational fluid mechanics problem of utmost significance. Boundary layer methodology is invoked for the mathematical modeling of fluidic system to study the heat and mass transport improvement of nanofluid with base water 3D-MHD flow model with an exponentially stretched surface involving three types of nanoparticles Fe3O4 (magnetite), Ag (silver) and C140H42O20 (graphene oxide). The representative 3D PDEs for nanofluidic system are converted into equivalent nonlinear ODE-based system via suitable similarity transformation. The results of the three nanofluidic models are calculated by applying Adams numerical technique for influential outcomes of aggressing parameters including Hartmann number M, wall stretching ratio P, thermal radiation Rd and heat source/sink hs to observe the effecting profiles of temperature and velocity fields. The obtained numerical data are utilized for Bayesian regularization knack-based intelligent computing method to construct the networks for approximate solution dynamic of nanofluidic models. The worth and value of designed Bayesian regularization knack-based networks (BRKNs) is established by regression index measurements, error histogram studies and convergence curves with negligible level of mean square error (E-12 to E-10) for the exhaustive simulations.

AB A framework through which machine learning can guide mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems is presented and shown to yield mathematical insight on important open problems in different areas of pure mathematics.
   The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures(1), most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture(2), a Millennium Prize Problem(3). Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups(4). Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.

AB Groundwater is a crucial resource across agricultural, civil, and industrial sectors. The prediction of groundwater pollution due to various chemical components is vital for planning, policymaking, and management of groundwater resources. In the last two decades, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for groundwater quality (GWQ) modeling has grown exponentially. This review assesses all supervised, semisupervised, unsupervised, and ensemble ML models implemented to predict any groundwater quality parameter, making this the most extensive modern review on this topic.Neural networks are the most used ML model in GWQ modeling. Their usage has declined in recent years, giving rise to more accurate or advanced techniques such as deep learning or unsupervised algorithms. Iran and the United States lead the world in areas modeled, with a wealth of historical data available. Nitrate has been modeled most exhaustively, targeted by nearly half of all studies. Advancements in future work will be made with further implementation of deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence or other cutting-edge techniques, application of these techniques for sparsely studied variables, the modeling of new or unique study areas, and the implementation of ML techniques for groundwater quality management.

AB Machine learning (ML) has enabled ground-breaking advances in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, from improvements in cancer diagnosis, to the identification of novel drugs and drug targets as well as protein structure prediction. Drug formulation is an essential stage in the discovery and development of new medicines. Through the design of drug formulations, pharmaceutical scientists can engineer important properties of new medicines, such as improved bioavailability and targeted delivery. The traditional approach to drug formulation development relies on iterative trial-and-error, requiring a large number of resource-intensive and time-consuming in vitro and in vivo experiments. This review introduces the basic concepts of ML-directed workflows and discusses how these tools can be used to aid in the development of various types of drug formulations. ML-directed drug formulation development offers unparalleled opportunities to fast-track development efforts, uncover new materials, innovative formulations, and generate new knowledge in drug formulation science. The review also highlights the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as generative models, Bayesian deep learning, reinforcement learning, and self-driving laboratories, which have been gaining momentum in drug discovery and chemistry and have potential in drug formulation development.

AB In the digital environment, chatbots as customer service agents assist consumers in decision making. Based on the computers-are-social-actors paradigm, this study examines the perceived differences in communication quality and privacy risks between different service agents and their impact on consumers' adoption intention, and in-vestigates whether these perceived differences might depend on differences in the user's human interaction need. A series of five scenario-based experiments were carried out to collect data and test hypotheses. It was discovered that: different types of service agents directly affect consumers' adoption intention; perceived communication quality and privacy risk mediate the effect of service agent type on adoption intention; the effects of service agent type on perceived accuracy, communicative competence, and privacy risk are moderated by the need for human interaction. The findings of this study provide important insights into the rational use of human-computer interacation in e-commerce.

AB This study examines the antecedents of customers' willingness and objection to use artificially intelligent robotic devices in hospitality services (full-service and limited-service hotels). Drawing on the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) theory, this study validates and extends the AIDUA framework in the hospitality service setting. The results point to the applicability of the AIDUA framework, suggesting that hospitality customers' intention to the use of artificially intelligent devices are influenced by social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance and effort expectancy, and emotions toward the artificially intelligent devices. Findings further suggest that compared to limited-service hotel customers, full-service hotel customers rely less on their social groups when evaluating artificially intelligent robotic devices; their emotions toward the use of artificially intelligent devices are less likely to be influenced by effort expectancy; and their emotions cause less impact on their objection to the use. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed. Limitations and future study recommendations are provided.

AB Under the rapid economic development trend, exploring the resource optimization strategy of cultural and creative enterprises for sustainable socio-economic development is highly relevant. This study applies the recommendation system to decision-making and resource optimization of entrepreneurial projects for the current situation of complexs entrepreneurial enterprises in the cultural and creative industry (CCI). The neural network algorithm (NNA) is adopted to model project features, user's behavioral and content features. Finally, a recommendation and resource optimization model based on NNA is constructed for CCI-related entrepreneurial projects, and the model is evaluated and analyzed. The results demonstrate that with the increase in the training period, the model's recognition accuracy reaches 81.64%. Besides, the prediction error of the recommender system is minimized when the word vector length is 200, and the number of implied features is 200. Therefore, the entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model can significantly improve the recognition accuracy and reduce prediction errors, providing experimental references and contributing to the subsequent sustainable development of social economy and entrepreneurial resource optimization.

AB Progress in neurotechnology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides unprecedented insights into the human brain. There are increasing possibilities to influence and measure brain activity. These developments raise multifaceted ethical and legal questions. The proponents of neurorights argue in favour of introducing new human rights to protect mental processes and brain data. This article discusses the necessity and advantages of introducing new human rights focusing on the proposed new human right to mental self-determination and the right to freedom of thought as enshrined in Art.18 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Art. 9 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I argue that the right to freedom of thought can be coherently interpreted as providing comprehensive protection of mental processes and brain data, thus offering a normative basis regarding the use of neurotechnologies. Besides, I claim that an evolving interpretation of the right to freedom of thought is more convincing than introducing a new human right to mental self-determination.

AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is seen in approximately one-third of diabetes patients worldwide, leads to irreversible vision loss and even blindness if not diagnosed and treated in time. It is vital to limit the progression of DR disease in order to prevent the loss of vision in diabetic patients. It is therefore essential that DR disease is diagnosed at an early phase. Thanks to retinal screening at least twice a year, DR disease can be diagnosed in its early phases. However, due to the variations and complexity of DR, it is really difficult to determine the phase of DR disease in current clinical diagnoses. This paper presents a robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based model that can overcome nonlinear dynamics with low computational complexity and high classification accuracy using fundus images to determine the phase of DR disease. The proposed model consists of four stages, excluding the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, fractal analysis is performed to reveal the presence of chaos in the dataset consisting of 12,500 color fundus images. In the first stage, two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT) is applied to the dataset consisting of color fundus images in order to prevent information loss in the images and to reveal their characteristic features. In the second stage, 96 features are extracted by applying statistical- and entropy-based feature functions to approximate, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matrices of 2D-SWT. In the third stage, the features that keep the classifier performance high are selected by a chaotic-based wrapper approach consisting of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithms (CPSO) to cope with both chaoticity and computational complexity in the fundus images. At the last stage, an AI-based classification model is created with the recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) architecture by selecting the lowest number of feature sets that can keep the classification performance high. The performance of the DR disease classification model was tested on 2500 color fundus image data, which included five classes: no DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and proliferative DR (PDR). The robustness of the DR disease classification model was confirmed by the 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, the classification performance of the proposed model is compared with the support vector machine (SVM), which is one of the machine learning techniques. The results obtained show that the proposed model can overcome nonlinear dynamics in color fundus images with low computational complexity and is very effective and successful in precisely diagnosing all phases of DR disease.

AB The paper aims at investigation of the nexus between Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and environmental sustainability in addition to exploring the long-run and short-run effects of Industry 4.0 on CO2 emissions. For this end, energy consumption, internet and communication technology (ICT) exports, research and development (R&D), artificial intelligence (AI), ICT technology patents and bitcoin are taken as control variables of Industry 4.0 for a panel of 9 countries that contribute to 62% of the total CO2 emissions in the world. For this purpose, the paper follows two approaches. First, the paper proposes utilization of AI and ICT technology patents, technology-related R&Ds and ICT exports as variables of I4.0 in addition to investigating the effects of economic growth, energy consumption and bitcoin. Second, to control structural changes and nonlinearity in the cointegrating relations and existence of degenerate cointegration, Fourier panel bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag model (FPBARDL) is utilized. Afterwards, FPBARDL based long, short and strong causality analyses are conducted. The empirical findings revealed positive impacts of all I4.0-related variables on emissions in the long-run. Though I4.0 related AI and ICT innovation has no direct effect in the short-run, its effects are determined through increased energy con-sumption towards emissions. The strong positive effects of energy consumption and positive effects of economic growth, ICT exports and R&D are observed both in the short and long-run. In addition to positive impacts of I4.0 on environment, the findings favor insufficiency of policies focusing on lowering emissions in I4.0 context.Policy recommendations include strong commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energies and trade policies with environmental concerns.

AB Every year, millions of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are acquired in hospitals across the world. These have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of many neurological diseases, but their morpho-metric analysis has not yet been possible due to their anisotropic resolution. We present an artificial intelligence technique, "SynthSR," that takes clinical brain MRI scans with any MR contrast (T1, T2, etc.), orientation (axial/ coronal/sagittal), and resolution and turns them into high-resolution T1 scans that are usable by virtually all existing human neuroimaging tools. We present results on segmentation, registration, and atlasing of >10,000 scans of controls and patients with brain tumors, strokes, and Alzheimer's disease. SynthSR yields mor-phometric results that are very highly correlated with what one would have obtained with high-resolution T1 scans. SynthSR allows sample sizes that have the potential to overcome the power limitations of prospective research studies and shed new light on the healthy and diseased human brain.

AB Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as effective energy storage and have become the main component of power supply systems. Accurate battery state prediction is key to ensuring reliability and has significant guidance for optimizing the performance of battery power systems and replacement. Due to the complex and dynamic operations of lithium-ion batteries, the state parameters change with either the working condition or the aging process. The accuracy of online state prediction is difficult to improve, which is an urgent issue that needs to be solved to ensure a reliable and safe power supply. Currently, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), battery state prediction methods based on data-driven methods have high precision and robustness to improve state prediction accuracy. The demanding characteristics of test time are reduced, and this has become the research focus in the related fields. Therefore, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was improved in the data modeling process to establish a deep convolutional neural network ensemble transfer learning (DCNN-ETL) method, which plays a significant role in battery state prediction. This paper reviews and compares several mathematical DCNN models. The key features are identified on the basis of the modeling capability for the state prediction. Then, the prediction methods are classified on the basis of the identified features. In the process of deep learning (DL) calculation, specific criteria for evaluating different modeling accuracy levels are defined. The identified features of the state prediction model are taken advantage of to give relevant conclusions and suggestions. The DCNN-ETL method is selected to realize the reliable state prediction of lithium-ion batteries.

AB The developments of information and automation technologies have opened a new era for weed management to fit physical and chemical control treatments to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of weed distributions in agricultural fields. This review describes the technologies of site-specific weed management (SSWM) systems, evaluates their ecological and economic benefits and gives a perspective for the implementation in practical farming. Sensor technologies including 3D cameras, multispectral imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for weed classification and computer-based decision algorithms are described in combination with precise spraying and hoeing operations. Those treatments are targeted for patches of weeds or individual weed plants. Cameras can also guide inter-row hoes precisely in the centre between two crop rows at much higher driving speed. Camera-guided hoeing increased selectivity and weed control efficacy compared with manual steered hoeing. Robots combine those guiding systems with in-row hoeing or spot spraying systems that can selectively control individual weeds within crop rows. Results with patch spraying show at least 50% saving of herbicides in various crops without causing additional costs for weed control in the following years. A challenge with these technologies is the interoperability of sensing and controllers. Most of the current SSWM technologies use their own IT protocols that do not allow connecting different sensors and implements. Plug & play standards for linking detection, decision making and weeding would improve the adoption of new SSWM technologies and reduce operational costs. An important impact of SSWM is the potential contribution to the EU-Green Deal targets to reduce pesticide use and increase biodiversity. However, further on-farm research is needed for integrating those technologies into agricultural practice.

TI Performance of ChatGPT on the pharmacist licensing examination in Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

DT Article
DE Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Educational measurement; Pharmacists;
   Pharmacy licensure
AB Background:ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model trained for conversations. ChatGPT has been widely applied in general medical education and cardiology, but its application in pharmacy has been lacking. This study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT on the Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination and investigated its potential role in pharmacy education. Methods:ChatGPT was used on the first Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination in 2023 in Mandarin and English. The questions were entered manually one by one. Graphical questions, chemical formulae, and tables were excluded. Textual questions were scored according to the number of correct answers. Chart question scores were determined by multiplying the number and the correct rate of text questions. This study was conducted from March 5 to March 10, 2023, by using ChatGPT 3.5. Results:The correct rate of ChatGPT in Chinese and English questions was 54.4% and 56.9% in the first stage, and 53.8% and 67.6% in the second stage. On the Chinese test, only pharmacology and pharmacochemistry sections received passing scores. The English test scores were higher than the Chinese test scores across all subjects and were significantly higher in dispensing pharmacy and clinical pharmacy as well as therapeutics. Conclusion:ChatGPT 3.5 failed the Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination. Although it is not able to pass the examination, it can be improved quickly through deep learning. It reminds us that we should not only use multiple-choice questions to assess a pharmacist's ability, but also use more variety of evaluations in the future. Pharmacy education should be changed in line with the examination, and students must be able to use AI technology for self-learning. More importantly, we need to help students develop humanistic qualities and strengthen their ability to interact with patients, so that they can become warm-hearted healthcare professionals.

AB Cloud computing provides the flexible architecture where data and resources are dispersed at various locations and are accessible from various industrial environments. Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms' challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) can extract visual information from histopathological slides and yield biological insight and clinical biomarkers. Whole slide images are cut into thousands of tiles and classification problems are often weakly-supervised: the ground truth is only known for the slide, not for every single tile. In classical weakly-supervised analysis pipelines, all tiles inherit the slide label while in multiple-instance learning (MIL), only bags of tiles inherit the label. However, it is still unclear how these widely used but markedly different approaches perform relative to each other.We implemented and systematically compared six methods in six clinically relevant end-to-end prediction tasks using data from N = 2980 patients for training with rigorous external validation. We tested three classical weakly-supervised approaches with convolutional neural networks and vision transformers (ViT) and three MIL-based approaches with and without an additional attention module. Our results empirically demonstrate that histological tumor subtyping of renal cell carcinoma is an easy task in which all approaches achieve an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of above 0.9. In contrast, we report significant performance differences for clinically relevant tasks of mutation prediction in colorectal, gastric, and bladder cancer. In these mutation prediction tasks, classical weakly-supervised workflows outperformed MIL-based weakly-supervised methods for mutation prediction, which is surprising given their simplicity. This shows that new end-to-end image analysis pipelines in computational pathology should be compared to classical weakly-supervised methods. Also, these findings motivate the development of new methods which combine the elegant assumptions of MIL with the empirically observed higher performance of classical weakly-supervised approaches. We make all source codes publicly available at https://github.com/KatherLab/HIA , allowing easy application of all methods to any similar task.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the past several years, the world has witnessed an acute surge in the production and usage of smart devices which are referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices interact with each other as well as with their surrounding environments to sense, gather and process data of various kinds. Such devices are now part of our everyday's life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.

AB Driven by privacy concerns and the visions of deep learning, the last four years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the applicability mechanism of machine learning (ML). An emerging model, called federated learning (FL), is rising above both centralized systems and on-site analysis, to be a new fashioned design for ML implementation. It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work. In this context, we elaborate comprehensive taxonomies covering various challenging aspects, contributions, and trends in the literature, including core system models and designs, application areas, privacy and security, and resource management. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges and open research directions toward more robust FL systems.

AB The integration of drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains can produce exceptional solutions to today complex problems in smart cities. A drone, which essentially is a data-gathering robot, can access geographical areas that are difficult, unsafe, or even impossible for humans to reach. Besides, communicating amongst themselves, such drones need to be in constant contact with other ground-based agents such as IoT sensors, robots, and humans. In this paper, an intelligent technique is proposed to predict the signal strength from a drone to IoT devices in smart cities in order to maintain the network connectivity, provide the desired quality of service (QoS), and identify the drone coverage area. An artificial neural network (ANN) based efficient and accurate solution is proposed to predict the signal strength from a drone based on several pertinent factors such as drone altitude, path loss, distance, transmitter height, receiver height, transmitted power, and signal frequency. Furthermore, the signal strength estimates are then used to predict the drone flying path. The findings show that the proposed ANN technique has achieved a good agreement with the validation data generated via simulations, yielding determination coefficient $R<^>2$R2 to be 0.96 and 0.98, for variation in drone altitude and distance from a drone, respectively. Therefore, the proposed ANN technique is reliable, useful, and fast to estimate the signal strength, determine the optimal drone flying path, and predict the next location based on received signal strength.

AB The increasing world population and availability of energy hungry smart devices are major reasons for alarmingly high electricity consumption in the current times. So far, various simulation tools, engineering and Artificial Intelligence based methods are being used to perform optimal electricity demand forecasting. While engineering methods use dynamic equations to forecast, the AI-based methods use historical data to predict future demand. However, modeling of nonlinear electricity demand patterns is still underdeveloped for robust solutions as the existing methods are useful only for handling short-term dependencies. Moreover, the existing methods are static in nature because they are purely historical data driven. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to forecast electricity demand by taking care of long-term historical dependencies. Initially, the cluster analysis is performed on the electricity consumption data of all months to generate season based segmented data. Subsequently, load trend characterization is carried out to have a deeper insight of metadata falling into each of the clusters. Further, Long Short Term Memory network multi-input multi-output models are trained to forecast electricity demand based upon the season, day and interval data. In the present work, we have also incorporated the concept of moving window based active learning to improve prediction results. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the electricity consumption data of Union Territory Chandigarh, India. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the prediction results with Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Support Vector Regression models.

TI Parallel convolutional processing using an integrated photonic tensor
   core
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)(1), the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important(2). Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (10(12) MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs(3)). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates(3-5), ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides(6,7), and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services.

DT Review

ID PROTEIN-SEQUENCE; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; DISEASE
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to analytical algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.

TI The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose: The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge was created to show an application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, promote collaboration to catalyze AI model creation, and identify innovators in medical imaging.
   Materials and Methods: The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age.
   Results: A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively.
   Conclusion: The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted. Future ML challenges will catalyze collaboration and development of ML tools and methods that can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. (c) RSNA, 2018

AB Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an important benchmark to assess the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly deep learning ensembled-based models. However, the ability for UQ using current AI-based methods is not only limited in terms of computational resources but it also requires changes to topology and optimization processes, as well as multiple performances to monitor model instabilities. From both geo-engineering and societal perspectives, a predictive groundwater table (GWT) model presents an important challenge, where a lack of UQ limits the validity of findings and may undermine science-based decisions. To overcome and address these limitations, a novel ensemble, an automated random deactivating connective weights approach (ARDCW), is presented and applied to retrieved geographical locations of GWT data from a geo-engineering project in Stockholm, Sweden. In this approach, the UQ was achieved via a combination of several derived ensembles from a fixed optimum topology subjected to randomly switched off weights, which allow predictability with one forward pass. The process was developed and programmed to provide trackable performance in a specific task and access to a wide variety of different internal characteristics and libraries. A comparison of performance with Monte Carlo dropout and quantile regression using computer vision and control task metrics showed significant progress in the ARDCW. This approach does not require changes in the optimization process and can be applied to already trained topologies in a way that outperforms other models.

TI Modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in
   China under public health interventions

   Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR)
AB Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, coincided with chunyun, the period of mass migration for the annual Spring Festival. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic.
   Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic.
   Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction.
   Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.

ID CONSUMPTION; STRATEGY
AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced automated fault diagnosis (AFD) has become increasingly popular for chiller fault diagnosis with promising classification performance. In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to Practitioners-This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.

AB Timely detection and diagnosis are urgently needed to guide epidemiological measures, infection control, antiviral treatment, and vaccine research. In this review, biomarkers/indicators for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the environment are summarized and discussed. It is concluded that the detection methods targeting antibodies are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases since most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms. However, antibody detection methods can be combined with quantitative realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, and boost vaccine research. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection methods targeting antigens need to be developed urgently. Various specimens for diagnosis or detection are compared and analyzed. Among them, deep throat saliva and induced sputum are desired for RT-qPCR test or other early detection technologies. Chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, RT-qPCR, lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (LFICS) for diagnosis of COVID-19 are summarized and compared. Specially, potential electrochemical (EC) biosensor, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensor, field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensor, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 are emphasized. Finally, some commercialized portable detection device, current challenges and future directions are discussed.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in a high-computation paradigm enabled with smart applications in the Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) wireless communication networks. These networks have an avenue for generating a considerable amount of heterogeneous data by the expanding number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart environments. However, storing and processing massive data with limited computational capability and energy availability at local nodes in the IoT network has been a significant difficulty, mainly when deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to extract discriminatory information from the massive amount of data for different tasks.Therefore, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has evolved as a promising computing paradigm leveraged with efficient technology to improve the quality of services of edge devices and network performance better than cloud computing networks, addressing challenging problems of latency and computation-intensive offloading in a UAV-assisted framework. This paper provides a comprehensive review of intelligent UAV computing technology to enable 6G networks over smart environments. We highlight the utility of UAV computing and the critical role of Federated Learning (FL) in meeting the challenges related to energy, security, task offloading, and latency of IoT data in smart environments. We present the reader with an insight into UAV computing, advantages, applications, and challenges that can provide helpful guidance for future research.

TI Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to
   Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum
SO JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ERA; IMPACT; CARE
AB IMPORTANCE The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose "which response was better" and judged both "the quality of information provided" (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and "the empathy or bedside manner provided" (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.
   RESULTS Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6%(95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P <.001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (t = 13.3; P <.001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (>= 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t = 18.9; P <.001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (>= 4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.
   CONCLUSIONS In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.

AB To enhance prediction reliability and accuracy, a hybrid model based on the promising principle of "decomposition and ensemble" and a recently proposed meta-heuristic called grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is introduced for daily PM2.5 concentration forecasting. Compared with existing PM2.5 forecasting methods, this proposed model has improved the prediction accuracy and hit rates of directional prediction. The proposed model involves three main steps, i.e., decomposing the original PM2.5 series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) for simplifying the complex data; individually predicting each IMF with support vector regression (SVR) optimized by GWO; integrating all predicted IMFs for the ensemble result as the final prediction by another SVR optimized by GWO. Seven benchmark models, including single artificial intelligence (AI) models, other decomposition-ensemble models with different decomposition methods and models with the same decomposition-ensemble method but optimized by different algorithms, are considered to verify the superiority of the proposed hybrid model. The empirical study indicates that the proposed hybrid decomposition-ensemble model is remarkably superior to all considered benchmark models for its higher prediction accuracy and hit rates of directional prediction.

AB In this paper, we explore how manufacturing firms and their customers co-create digital service innovations in an attempt to address the digitalization paradox. We present empirical insights from a case study of four manufacturers and their customer relationships. The results suggest that value co-creation in digital servitization is best managed through an agile micro-service innovation approach. Such an approach requires incremental micro-service investments, sprint-based micro-service development, and micro-service learning by doing to ensure customized and scalable digital service offerings. The proposed agile co-creation model provides insight into the phases, activities, and organizational principles of a micro-service innovation approach. Relational teams that pool knowledge from providers' and customers' strategic, technological, and operational areas are crucial to ensure successful cooperation and governance for agile co-creation. This paper offers insight into how companies engage in agile co-creation processes, with important recommendations for innovation in manufacturing firms in the era of digitalization.

TI Deep learning-based artificial intelligence model to assist thyroid
   nodule diagnosis and management: a multicentre diagnostic study
SO LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Strategies for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into thyroid nodule management require additional development and testing. We developed a deep-learning AI model (ThyNet) to differentiate between malignant tumours and benign thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate how ThyNet could help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary fine needle aspiration.
   Methods ThyNet was developed and trained on 18049 images of 8339 patients (training set) from two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China) and tested on 4305 images of 2775 patients (total test set) from seven hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the Guangzhou Army General Hospital, Guangzhou, China; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China) in three stages. All nodules in the training and total test set were pathologically confirmed. The diagnostic performance of ThyNet was first compared with 12 radiologists (test set A); a ThyNet-assisted strategy, in which ThyNet assisted diagnoses made by radiologists, was developed to improve diagnostic performance of radiologists using images (test set B); the ThyNet assisted strategy was then tested in a real-world clinical setting (using images and videos; test set C). In a simulated scenario, the number of unnecessary fine needle aspirations avoided by ThyNet-assisted strategy was calculated.
   Findings The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for accurate diagnosis of ThyNet (0.922 [95% CI 0.910-0.934]) was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (0.839 [0.834-0.844]; p<0.0001). Furthermore, ThyNet-assisted strategy improved the pooled AUROC of the radiologists from 0.837 (0.832-0.842) when diagnosing without ThyNet to 0.875 (0.871-0.880; p<0.0001) with ThyNet for reviewing images, and from 0.862 (0.851-0.872) to 0.873 (0.863-0.883; p<0.0001) in the clinical test, which used images and videos. In the simulated scenario, the number of fine needle aspirations decreased from 61.9% to 35.2% using the ThyNet-assisted strategy, while missed malignancy decreased from 18.9% to 17.0%.
   Interpretation The ThyNet-assisted strategy can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists and help reduce unnecessary fine needle aspirations for thyroid nodules. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps, challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future directions.

AB As the 5G standard is being completed, academia and industry have begun to consider a more developed cellular communication technique, 6G, which is expected to achieve high data rates up to 1 Tb/s and broad frequency bands of 100 GHz to 3 THz. Besides the significant upgrade of the key communication metrics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been envisioned by many researchers as the most important feature of 6G, since the state-of-the-art machine learning technique has been adopted as the top solution in many extremely complex scenarios. Network intelligentization will be the new trend to address the challenges of exponentially increasing number of connected heterogeneous devices. However, compared with the application of machine learning in other fields, such as computer games, current research on intelligent networking still has a long way to go to realize the automatically- configured cellular communication systems. Various problems in terms of communication system, machine learning architectures, and computation efficiency should be addressed for the full use of this technique in 6G. In this paper, we analyze machine learning techniques and introduce 10 most critical challenges in advancing the intelligent 6G system.

AB The reform of the EU ETS markets in 2017 has induced new carbon price forecasting challenges. This study proposes a novel decomposition-ensemble paradigm VMD-GARCH/LSTM-LSTM model to better adapt to the current fast-rising and volatile carbon price. Three significant steps are involved: (1) the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm decomposes the carbon price series into sub-modes; (2) The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network predicts low-frequency sub-modes, with the GARCH model predicting high frequency sub-modes; (3) the forecasts from sub-modes are ensembled through the LSTM non-linear ensemble method. Combining econometric and artificial intelligence methods, our proposed model has an excellent performance on the current carbon price, with smaller errors than single econometrics or AI models or decomposition-ensemble models with linear simple superposition approaches. VMD have significant advantages over their alternative algorithms. Moreover, the LSTM involved in our model is well suited to forecast the rising carbon price in late EU ETS Phase III, providing good insight into risk aversion for participants.

AB The rapid development of wireless communications especially with the coming of 5G, and artificial intelligence (AI) provides us a wonderful and intelligent life. Nevertheless, it is at the expense of a substantial increase in electromagnetic (EM) inference and pollution. EM absorbing materials that can dissipate the incident EM waves are of crucial importance in solving EM pollution and thus have received significant attention. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current status and new frontiers on EM absorption materials. It begins with the fundamentals of EM apsorption materials, with an emphasis on their mechanisms and characterizations. Discussion is then made on the chemical strategies of component optimization and nanostructure engineering for developing traditional EM absorption materials. Thereafter, new advances particularly in next-generation EM materials including superhydrophobic, self-healing, high-temperature, optically manipulatable and electrically tuning EM absorbing materials as well as EM-electricity harvester are highlighted. Finally, this review is concluded with an outlook of future research on EM absorption materials, major challenges to be addressed and possible solutions.

TI COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Using a Simple 2D Deep Learning Framework
   With a Single Chest CT Image: Model Development and Validation

AB Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread explosively worldwide since the beginning of 2020. According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians.
   Objective: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases.
   Methods: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers.
   Results: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively).
   Conclusions: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3.

AB Object recognition is among the basic survival skills of human beings and other animals. To date, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted high-performance object recognition is primarily visual-based, empowered by the rapid development of sensing and computational capabilities. Here, we report a tactile-olfactory sensing array, which was inspired by the natural sense-fusion system of star-nose mole, and can permit real-time acquisition of the local topography, stiffness, and odor of a variety of objects without visual input. The tactileolfactory information is processed by a bioinspired olfactory-tactile associated machinelearning algorithm, essentially mimicking the biological fusion procedures in the neural system of the star-nose mole. Aiming to achieve human identification during rescue missions in challenging environments such as dark or buried scenarios, our tactile-olfactory intelligent sensing system could classify 11 typical objects with an accuracy of 96.9% in a simulated rescue scenario at a fire department test site. The tactile-olfactory bionic sensing system required no visual input and showed superior tolerance to environmental interference, highlighting its great potential for robust object recognition in difficult environments where other methods fall short.

AB Background Accurate lymph node staging is important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with bladder cancer. We aimed to develop a lymph node metastases diagnostic model (LNMDM) on whole slide images and to assess the clinical effect of an artificial intelligence-assisted (AI) workflow. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in China, we included consecutive patients with bladder cancer who had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, and from whom whole slide images of lymph node sections were available, for model development. We excluded patients with non-bladder cancer and concurrent surgery, or low-quality images. Patients from two hospitals (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were assigned before a cutoff date to a training set and after the date to internal validation sets for each hospital. Patients from three other hospitals (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were included as external validation sets. A validation subset of challenging cases from the five validation sets was used to compare performance between the LNMDM and pathologists, and two other datasets (breast cancer from the CAMELYON16 dataset and prostate cancer from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University) were collected for a multi-cancer test. The primary endpoint was diagnostic sensitivity in the four prespecified groups (ie, the five validation sets, a single-lymph-node test set, the multi-cancer test set, and the subset for a performance comparison between the LNMDM and pathologists). Findings Between Jan 1, 2013 and Dec 31, 2021, 1012 patients with bladder cancer had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection and were included (8177 images and 20 954 lymph nodes). We excluded 14 patients (165 images) with concurrent non-bladder cancer and also excluded 21 low-quality images. We included 998 patients and 7991 images (881 [88%] men; 117 [12%] women; median age 64 years [IQR 56-72]; ethnicity data not available; 268 [27%] with lymph node metastases) to develop the LNMDM. The area under the curve (AUC) for accurate diagnosis of the LNMDM ranged from 0 center dot 978 (95% CI 0 center dot 960-0 center dot 996) to 0 center dot 998 (0 center dot 996-1 center dot 000) in the five validation sets. Performance comparisons between the LNMDM and pathologists showed that the diagnostic sensitivity of the model (0 center dot 983 [95% CI 0 center dot 941-0 center dot 998]) substantially exceeded that of both junior pathologists (0 center dot 906 [0 center dot 871-0 center dot 934]) and senior pathologists (0 center dot 947 [0 center dot 919-0 center dot 968]), and that AI assistance improved sensitivity for both junior (from 0 center dot 906 without AI to 0 center dot 953 with AI) and senior (from 0 center dot 947 to 0 center dot 986) pathologists. In the multi-cancer test, the LNMDM maintained an AUC of 0 center dot 943 (95% CI 0 center dot 918-0 center dot 969) in breast cancer images and 0 center dot 922 (0 center dot 884-0 center dot 960) in prostate cancer images. In 13 patients, the LNMDM detected tumour micrometastases that had been missed by pathologists who had previously classified these patients' results as negative. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the LNMDM would enable pathologists to exclude 80-92% of negative slides while maintaining 100% sensitivity in clinical application.
   Interpretation We developed an AI-based diagnostic model that did well in detecting lymph node metastases, particularly micrometastases. The LNMDM showed substantial potential for clinical applications in improving the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' work. Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Sentiment analysis (SA) has gained much traction In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance. This survey paper examines primary taxonomy and newly released multimodal fusion architectures. Recent developments in MSA architectures are divided into ten categories, namely early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion, model-level fusion, tensor fusion, hierarchical fusion, bi-modal fusion, attention-based fusion, quantum-based fusion and word-level fusion. A comparison of several architectural evolutions in terms of MSA fusion categories and their relative strengths and limitations are presented. Finally, a number of interdisciplinary applications and future research directions are proposed.

AB Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU's task offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep-Q-learning (DDQN), respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.

AB Accurately modeling the structures of proteins and their complexes using artificial intelligence is revolutionizing molecular biology. Experimental data enable a candidate-based approach to systematically model novel protein assemblies. Here, we use a combination of in-cell crosslinking mass spectrometry and co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CoFrac-MS) to identify protein-protein interactions in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We show that crosslinking interactions prior to cell lysis reveals protein interactions that are often lost upon cell lysis. We predict the structures of these protein interactions and others in the SubtiWiki database with AlphaFold-Multimer and, after controlling for the false-positive rate of the predictions, we propose novel structural models of 153 dimeric and 14 trimeric protein assemblies. Crosslinking MS data independently validates the AlphaFold predictions and scoring. We report and validate novel interactors of central cellular machineries that include the ribosome, RNA polymerase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, assigning function to several uncharacterized proteins. Our approach uncovers protein-protein interactions inside intact cells, provides structural insight into their interaction interfaces, and is applicable to genetically intractable organisms, including pathogenic bacteria.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive study of Federated Learning (FL) with an emphasis on enabling software and hardware platforms, protocols, real-life applications and use-cases. FL can be applicable to multiple domains but applying it to different industries has its own set of obstacles. FL is known as collaborative learning, where algorithm(s) get trained across multiple devices or servers with decentralized data samples without having to exchange the actual data. This approach is radically different from other more established techniques such as getting the data samples uploaded to servers or having data in some form of distributed infrastructure. FL on the other hand generates more robust models without sharing data, leading to privacy-preserved solutions with higher security and access privileges to data. This paper starts by providing an overview of FL. Then, it gives an overview of technical details that pertain to FL enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols, platforms, and real-life use-cases of FL to enable data scientists to build better privacy-preserving solutions for industries in critical need of FL. We also provide an overview of key challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore both the challenges and advantages of FL and present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how different architectures and protocols that use FL can fit together to deliver desired results.

TI Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing: A Selective Model
   Aggregation Approach
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; vehicular edge computing; model aggregation;
   contract theory
ID DESIGN
AB Federated learning is a newly emerged distributed machine learning paradigm, where the clients are allowed to individually train local deep neural network (DNN) models with local data and then jointly aggregate a global DNN model at the central server. Vehicular edge computing (VEC) aims at exploiting the computation and communication resources at the edge of vehicular networks. Federated learning in VEC is promising to meet the ever-increasing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in intelligent connected vehicles (ICV). Considering image classification as a typical AI application in VEC, the diversity of image quality and computation capability in vehicular clients potentially affects the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning. Accordingly, we propose a selective model aggregation approach, where "fine" local DNN models are selected and sent to the central server by evaluating the local image quality and computation capability. Regarding the implementation of model selection, the central server is not aware of the image quality and computation capability in the vehicular clients, whose privacy is protected under such a federated learning framework. To overcome this information asymmetry, we employ two-dimension contract theory as a distributed framework to facilitate the interactions between the central server and vehicular clients. The formulated problem is then transformed into a tractable problem through successively relaxing and simplifying the constraints, and eventually solved by a greedy algorithm. Using two datasets, i.e., MNIST and BelgiumTSC, our selective model aggregation approach is demonstrated to outperform the original federated averaging (FedAvg) approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Meanwhile, our approach also achieves higher utility at the central server compared with the baseline approaches.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science are leading to a promising transformative paradigm. ML, especially deep learning and physics-informed ML, is a valuable toolkit that complements incomplete domain-specific knowledge in conventional experimental and computational methods. ML can provide flexible techniques to facilitate the conceptual development of new robust predictive models for multiphase flows and reactors by finding hidden pattern/information/mechanism in a data set. Due to such emergence, we thereby comprehensively survey, explore, analyze, and discuss key advancements of recent ML applications to hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reactions in single-phase and multiphase flow systems from different aspects: (1) development of multiphase closure models of drag force, turbulence stresses and heat/mass transfer to improve the accuracy and efficiency of typical CFD simulations; (2) image reconstruction, regime identification, key parameter predictions, and optimization of multiphase flow and transport fields; (3) reaction kinetics modeling (e.g., predictions of reaction networks, kinetic parameters, and species production) and reaction condition optimization. These sections also discuss and analyze the key advantages and weakness of ML for solving the problems in the domain of multiphase flows and reactors. Finally, we summarize the under -solving challenges and opportunities in order to identify future directions that would be useful for the research community. Future development and study of multiphase flows and reactors are envisaged to be accelerated by ML and data science.

AB Purpose Robots are predicted to have a profound impact on the service sector. The emergence of robots has attracted increasing interest from business scholars and practitioners alike. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the business literature about the impact of service robots on customers and employees with the objective of guiding future research. Design/methodology/approach We analyzed the literature on service robots as they relate to customers and employees in business journals listed in the Financial Times top 50 journals plus all journals covered in the cross-disciplinary SERVSIG literature alerts. Findings The analysis of the identified studies yielded multiple observations about the impact of service robots on customers (e.g. overarching frameworks on acceptance and usage of service robots; characteristics of service robots and anthropomorphism; and potential for enhanced and deteriorated service experiences) and service employees (e.g. employee benefits such as reduced routine work, enhanced productivity and job satisfaction; potential negative consequences such as loss of autonomy and a range of negative psychological outcomes; opportunities for human-robot collaboration; job insecurity; and robot-related up-skilling and development requirements). We also conclude that current research on service robots is fragmented, is largely conceptual in nature and focused on the initial adoption stage. We feel that more research is needed to build an overarching theory. In addition, more empirical research is needed, especially on the long(er)-term usage service robots on actual behaviors, the well-being and potential downsides and (ethical) risks for customers and service employees. Research limitations/implications - Our review focused on the business and service literature. Future work may want to include additional literature streams, including those in computer science, engineering and information systems.
   Originality/value This article is the first to synthesize the business and service literature on the impact of service robots on customers and employees.

AB Deep Learning (DL) has been described as one of the key subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is trans-forming weed detection for site-specific weed management (SSWM). In the last demi-decade, DL techniques have been integrated with ground as well as aerial-based technologies to identify weeds in still image context and real-time setting. After observing the current research trend in DL-based weed detection, techniques are advancing by assisting precision weeding technologies to make smart decisions. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to present a systematic review study that involves DL-based weed detection techniques and technologies available for SSWM. To accomplish this study, a comprehensive literature survey was performed that consists of 60 closest technical papers on DL-based weed detection. The key findings are summarized as follows, a) transfer learning approach is a widely adopted technique to address weed detection in majority of research work, b) less focus navigated towards custom designed neural networks for weed detection task, c) based on the pretrained models deployed on test dataset, no one specific model can be attributed to have achieved high accuracy on multiple field images pertaining to several research studies, d) inferencing DL models on resource-constrained edge de-vices with limited number of dataset is lagging, e) different versions of YOLO (mostly v3) is a widely adopted model for detecting weeds in real-time scenario, f) SegNet and U-Net models have been deployed to accomplish semantic segmentation task in multispectral aerial imagery, g) less number of open-source weed image dataset acquired using drones, h) lack of research in exploring optimization and generalization techniques for weed identification in aerial images, i) research in exploring ways to design models that consume less training hours, low-power consumption and less parameters during training or inferencing, and j) slow-moving advances in optimizing models based on domain adaptation approach. In conclusion, this review will help researchers, DL experts, weed scientists, farmers, and technology extension specialist to gain updates in the area of DL techniques and technologies available for SSWM.

AB Machine learning (ML) has evolved rapidly over recent years with the promise to substantially alter and enhance the role of data science in a variety of disciplines. Compared with traditional approaches, ML offers advantages to handle complex problems, provide computational efficiency, propagate and treat uncertainties, and facilitate decision making. Also, the maturing of ML has led to significant advances in not only the main-stream artificial intelligence (AI) research but also other science and engineering fields, such as material science, bioengineering, construction management, and transportation engineering. This study conducts a comprehensive review of the progress and challenges of implementing ML in the earthquake engineering domain. A hierarchical attribute matrix is adopted to categorize the existing literature based on four traits identified in the field, such as ML method, topic area, data resource, and scale of analysis. The state-of-the-art review indicates to what extent ML has been applied in four topic areas of earthquake engineering, including seismic hazard analysis, system identification and damage detection, seismic fragility assessment, and structural control for earthquake mitigation. Moreover, research challenges and the associated future research needs are discussed, which include embracing the next generation of data sharing and sensor technologies, implementing more advanced ML techniques, and developing physics-guided ML models.

ID QUANTIFICATION
AB IMPORTANCE Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to analysis of medical imaging in recent years, but AI to guide the acquisition of ultrasonography images is a novel area of investigation. A novel deep-learning (DL) algorithm, trained on more than 5 million examples of the outcome of ultrasonographic probe movement on image quality, can provide real-time prescriptive guidance for novice operators to obtain limited diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic images.
   OBJECTIVE To test whether novice users could obtain 10-view transthoracic echocardiographic studies of diagnostic quality using this DL-based software.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, multicenter diagnostic study was conducted in 2 academic hospitals. A cohort of 8 nurses who had not previously conducted echocardiograms was recruited and trained with AI. Each nurse scanned 30 patients aged at least 18 years who were scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated echocardiogram at Northwestern Memorial Hospital or Minneapolis Heart Institute between March and May 2019. These scans were compared with those of sonographers using the same echocardiographic hardware but without AI guidance.
   INTERVENTIONS Each patient underwent paired limited echocardiograms: one from a nurse without prior echocardiography experience using the DL algorithm and the other from a sonographer without the DL algorithm. Five level 3-trained echocardiographers independently and blindly evaluated each acquisition.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four primary end points were sequentially assessed: qualitative judgement about left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and the presence of a pericardial effusion. Secondary end points included 6 other clinical parameters and comparison of scans by nurses vs sonographers.
   RESULTS A total of 240 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [16] years old; 139 men [57.9%]; 79 [32.9%] with body mass indexes >30) completed the study. Eight nurses each scanned 30 patients using the DL algorithm, producing studies judged to be of diagnostic quality for left ventricular size, function, and pericardial effusion in 237 of 240 cases (98.8%) and right ventricular size in 222 of 240 cases (92.5%). For the secondary end points, nurse and sonographer scans were not significantly different for most parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This DL algorithm allows novices without experience in ultrasonography to obtain diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic studies for evaluation of left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and presence of a nontrivial pericardial effusion, expanding the reach of echocardiography to clinical settings in which immediate interrogation of anatomy and cardiac function is needed and settings with limited resources.

AB This study presents the development of new empirical prediction models to evaluate swell pressure and unconfined compression strength of expansive soils (PsUCS-ES) using three soft computing methods, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and gene expression programming (GEP). An extensive database comprising 168 Ps and 145 UCS records was established after a comprehensive literature search. The nine most influential and easily determined geotechnical parameters were taken as the predictor variables. The network was trained and tested, and the predictions of the proposed models were compared with the observed results. The performance of all the models was tested using mean absolute error (MAE), root squared error (RSE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), regression coefficient (R2) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The sensitivity analysis indicated that the increasing order of inputs importance in case of Ps followed the order: maximum dry density MDD (30.5%) > optimum moisture content OMC (28.7%) > swell percent SP (28.1%) > clay fraction CF (9.4%) > plasticity index PI (3.2%) > specific gravity Gs (0.1%), whereas, in case of UCS it followed the order: sand (44%) > PI (26.3%) > MDD (16.8%) > silt (6.8%) > CF (3%) > SP (2.9%) > Gs (0.2%) > OMC (0.03%). Parametric analysis was also performed and the resulting trends were found to be in line with findings of past literature. The comparison results reflected that GEP and ANN are efficacious and reliable techniques for estimation of PsUCS-ES. The derived mathematical GP-based equations portray the novelty of GEP model and are comparatively simple and reliable. The Roverall values for PsUCS-ES followed the order: ANN > GEP > ANFIS, with all values lying above the acceptable range of 0.80. Hence, all the proposed AI approaches exhibit superior performance, possess high generalization and prediction capability, and evaluate the relative importance of the input parameters in predicting the PsUCS-ES. The GEP model outperformed the other two models in terms of closeness of training, validation and testing data set with the ideal fit (1:1) slope. Evidently the findings of this study can help researchers, designers and practitioners to readily evaluate the swell-strength characteristics of the widespread expansive soils thus curtailing their environmental vulnerabilities which leads to faster, safer and sustainable construction from the standpoint of environment friendly waste management.

AB Background Tongue images (the colour, size and shape of the tongue and the colour, thickness and moisture content of the tongue coating), reflecting the health state of the whole body according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been widely used in China for thousands of years. Herein, we investigated the value of tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome in the diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC).
   Methods From May 2020 to January 2021, we simultaneously collected tongue images and tongue coating samples from 328 patients with GC (all newly diagnosed with GC) and 304 non-gastric cancer (NGC) participants in China, and 16 S rDNA was used to characterize the microbiome of the tongue coating samples. Then, artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning models were established to evaluate the value of tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome in the diagnosis of GC. Considering that tongue imaging is more convenient and economical as a diagnostic tool, we further conducted a prospective multicentre clinical study from May 2020 to March 2022 in China and recruited 937 patients with GC and 1911 participants with NGC from 10 centres across China to further evaluate the role of tongue images in the diagnosis of GC. Moreover, we verified this approach in another independent external validation cohort that included 294 patients with GC and 521 participants with NGC from 7 centres. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01090362.
   Findings For the first time, we found that both tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome can be used as tools for the diagnosis of GC, and the area under the curve (AUC) value of the tongue image-based diagnostic model was 0.89. The AUC values of the tongue coating microbiome-based model reached 0.94 using genus data and 0.95 using species data. The results of the prospective multicentre clinical study showed that the AUC values of the three tongue image-based models for GCs reached 0.88-0.92 in the internal verification and 0.83-0.88 in the independent external verification, which were significantly superior to the combination of eight blood biomarkers.
   Interpretation Our results suggest that tongue images can be used as a stable method for GC diagnosis and are significantly superior to conventional blood biomarkers. The three kinds of tongue image-based AI deep learning diagnostic models that we developed can be used to adequately distinguish patients with GC from participants with NGC, even early GC and precancerous lesions, such as atrophic gastritis (AG).

AB Algorithms silently structure our lives. Algorithms can determine whether someone is hired, promoted, offered a loan, or provided housing as well as determine which political ads and news articles consumers see. Yet, the responsibility for algorithms in these important decisions is not clear. This article identifies whether developers have a responsibility for their algorithms later in use, what those firms are responsible for, and the normative grounding for that responsibility. I conceptualize algorithms as value-laden, rather than neutral, in that algorithms create moral consequences, reinforce or undercut ethical principles, and enable or diminish stakeholder rights and dignity. In addition, algorithms are an important actor in ethical decisions and influence the delegation of roles and responsibilities within these decisions. As such, firms should be responsible not only for the value-laden-ness of an algorithm but also for designing who-does-what within the algorithmic decision. As such, firms developing algorithms are accountable for designing how large a role individual will be permitted to take in the subsequent algorithmic decision. Counter to current arguments, I find that if an algorithm is designed to preclude individuals from taking responsibility within a decision, then the designer of the algorithm should be held accountable for the ethical implications of the algorithm in use.

AB Despite the importance of decision-making (DM) techniques for construction of effective decision models for supplier selection, there is a lack of a systematic literature review for it. This paper provides a systematic literature review on articles published from 2008 to 2012 on the application of DM techniques for supplier selection. By using a methodological decision analysis in four aspects including decision problems, decision makers, decision environments, and decision approaches, we finally selected and reviewed 123 journal articles. To examine the research trend on uncertain supplier selection, these articles are roughly classified into seven categories according to different uncertainties. Under such classification framework, 26 DM techniques are identified from three perspectives: (1) Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, (2) Mathematical programming (MP) techniques, and (3) Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We reviewed each of the 26 techniques and analyzed the means of integrating these techniques for supplier selection. Our survey provides the recommendation for future research and facilitates knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the application of DM techniques in supplier selection.

AB As a modern technological trend, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are extensively employed in various applications. The core purpose of condition monitoring systems, proactive fault diagnosis, is essential in ensuring UAV safety in these applications. In this research, adaptive health monitoring systems perform blade balancing fault diagnosis and classification. There seems to be a bidirectional unpredictability within each, and this paper proposes a hybrid-based transformed discrete wavelet and a multi-hidden-layer deep neural network (DNN) scheme to compensate for it. Wide-scale, high-quality, and comprehensive soft-labeled data are extracted from a selected hovering quad-copter incorporated with an accelerometer sensor via experimental work. A data-driven intelligent diagnostic strategy was investigated. Statistical characteristics of non-stationary six-leveled multi-resolution analysis in three axes are acquired. Two important feature selection methods were adopted to minimize computing time and improve classification accuracy when progressed into an artificial intelligence (AI) model for fault diagnosis. The suggested approach offers exceptional potential: the fault detection system identifies and predicts faults accurately as the resulting 91% classification accuracy exceeds current state-of-the-art fault diagnosis strategies. The proposed model demonstrated operational applicability on any multirotor UAV of choice.

AB Conventional artificial intelligence (AI) machine vision technology, based on the von Neumann architecture, uses separate sensing, computing, and storage units to process huge amounts of vision data generated in sensory terminals. The frequent movement of redundant data between sensors, processors and memory, however, results in high-power consumption and latency. A more efficient approach is to offload some of the memory and computational tasks to sensor elements that can perceive and process the optical signal simultaneously. Here, we proposed a non-volatile photomemristor, in which the reconfigurable responsivity can be modulated by the charge and/or photon flux through it and further stored in the device. The non-volatile photomemristor has a simple two-terminal architecture, in which photoexcited carriers and oxygen-related ions are coupled, leading to a displaced and pinched hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics. For the first time, non-volatile photomemristors implement computationally complete logic with photoresponse-stateful operations, for which the same photomemristor serves as both a logic gate and memory, using photoresponse as a physical state variable instead of light, voltage and memresistance. The polarity reversal of photomemristors shows great potential for in-memory sensing and computing with feature extraction and image recognition for neuromorphic vision.

AB Energy forecasting plays an important role in effective power grid management. The widespread adoption of emerging technologies and the increased reliance on renewable sources of energy have created a need for a robust and accurate system for energy forecasting. This demand is becoming increasingly relevant due to the ongoing 2022 energy crisis. Modern power systems are very complex with many complicated correlations between various forecasting factors and parameters. Furthermore, renewable energy is often dependent on weather conditions, which complicates the process of forecasting. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy forecasting tuned deep learning framework. By formatting predictors as a time series, two variations of recurrent neural networks (RNN)s have been implemented: long -short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks. However, both approaches present several hyperparameters that require adequate tuning to attain desirable performance. Therefore, this work also proposes an improved version of a well know swarm intelligence algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), tasked with tackling hyperparameter tuning for both approaches. To demonstrate the improvements made, three datasets have been constructed for evaluation from publicly available real-world data that contain relevant solar, wind, and power-grid load parameters alongside weather data. The proposed metaheuristic algorithm has been subjected to a comparative analysis with several contemporary metaheuristic algorithms to showcase the improvements made. The introduced metaheuristic demonstrated the best performance with a mean square error (MSE) rate for solar generation of only 0.0132 with LSTM methods and 0.0134 with GRU. Similar performance was observed for wind power generation forecasting with a MSE of 0.00292 with LSTM and 0.00287. When tackling power grid load forecasting a median MSE of 0.0162 was attained with LSTM and 0.01504 with GRU. Therefore there is great potential for tackling these tasks using the proposed approach. The best-performing models have been analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the factors that have the highest influence on energy generation and demand.

AB Blood glucose (BG) prediction is essential to the success of glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Empowered by the recent development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and deep learning technologies have been demonstrated to achieve the state of the art in BG prediction. However, it is challenging to implement such algorithms in actual clinical settings to provide persistent decision support due to the high demand for computational resources, while smartphone-based implementations are limited by short battery life and require users to carry the device. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model using an attention-based evidential recurrent neural network and design an IoMT-enabled wearable device to implement the embedded model, which comprises a low-cost and low-power system on a chip to perform Bluetooth connectivity and edge computing for real-time BG prediction and predictive hypoglycemia detection. In addition, we developed a smartphone app to visualize BG trajectories and predictions, and desktop and cloud platforms to backup data and fine-tune models. The embedded model was evaluated on three clinical data sets including 47 T1D subjects. The proposed model achieved superior performance of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and glucose-specific RMSE, and obtained the best accuracy for hypoglycemia detection when compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods. Moreover, we performed hardware-in-the-loop in silico trials with ten virtual T1D adults to test the whole IoMT system with predictive low-glucose management, which significantly reduced hypoglycemia and improved BG control.

AB Breast cancer is one of the precarious conditions that affect women, and a substantive cure has not yet been discovered for it. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients' survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the field. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study specifically adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identified. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area.

AB Seismology is a data rich and data-driven science. Application of machine learning for gaining new insights from seismic data is a rapidly evolving sub-field of seismology. The availability of a large amount of seismic data and computational resources, together with the development of advanced techniques can foster more robust models and algorithms to process and analyze seismic signals. Known examples or labeled data sets, are the essential requisite for building supervised models. Seismology has labeled data, but the reliability of those labels is highly variable, and the lack of high-quality labeled data sets to serve as ground truth as well as the lack of standard benchmarks are obstacles to more rapid progress. In this paper we present a high-quality, large-scale, and global data set of local earthquake and non-earthquake signals recorded by seismic instruments. The data set in its current state contains two categories: (1) local earthquake waveforms (recorded at "local" distances within 350 km of earthquakes) and (2) seismic noise waveforms that are free of earthquake signals. Together these data comprise similar to 1.2 million time series or more than 19,000 hours of seismic signal recordings. Constructing such a large-scale database with reliable labels is a challenging task. Here, we present the properties of the data set, describe the data collection, quality control procedures, and processing steps we undertook to insure accurate labeling, and discuss potential applications. We hope that the scale and accuracy of STEAD presents new and unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the seismological community and beyond.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in general and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular have attained successful results in medical image analysis and classification. A deep CNN architecture has been proposed in this paper for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the chest X-ray image classification. Due to the nonavailability of sufficient-size and good-quality chest X-ray image dataset, an effective and accurate CNN classification was a challenge. To deal with these complexities such as the availability of a very-small-sized and imbalanced dataset with image-quality issues, the dataset has been preprocessed in different phases using different techniques to achieve an effective training dataset for the proposed CNN model to attain its best performance. The preprocessing stages of the datasets performed in this study include dataset balancing, medical experts' image analysis, and data augmentation. The experimental results have shown the overall accuracy as high as 99.5% which demonstrates the good capability of the proposed CNN model in the current application domain. The CNN model has been tested in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the model has been tested using the 100 X-ray images of the original processed dataset which achieved an accuracy of 100%. In the second scenario, the model has been tested using an independent dataset of COVID-19 X-ray images. The performance in this test scenario was as high as 99.5%. To further prove that the proposed model outperforms other models, a comparative analysis has been done with some of the machine learning algorithms. The proposed model has outperformed all the models generally and specifically when the model testing was done using an independent testing set.

AB Deep learning plays a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models normally requires a large amount of data and can lead to privacy concerns. Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health systems.
   In this paper, to address the above-mentioned challenges, we design a novel end-to-end framework in a federated setting for ECG-based healthcare using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The federated setting is used to solve challenges such as data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework effectively classifies different arrhythmias using an autoencoder and a classifier, both based on a CNN. Additionally, we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier for interpretability of the classification results, which helps clinical practitioners to interpret the predictions of the classifier and to make quick and reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the baseline Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Boston's Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) Arrhythmia database. The trained classifier outperformed existing work by achieving accuracy up to 94.5% and 98.9% for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with five-fold cross-validation. We also propose a new communication cost reduction method to reduce the communication costs and to enhance the privacy of users' data in the federated setting. While the proposed framework was tested and validated for ECG classification, it is general enough to be extended to many other healthcare applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrical load forecasting plays a vital role in the operation and planning of power plants for the utility companies and policy makers to design stable and reliable energy infrastructure. Load forecasting is categorized in long-term, mid-term and short-term. Among them, short term load forecasting that monitors weekly, daily, hourly and even sub-hourly operations is gaining a lot of attention which saves time and cost while satisfying consumers' needs without interruption. Different models such as conventional, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hybrid models have been developed to investigate shortterm load forecasting. However, these models suffers various issues such as low speed convergence (conventional), high complexity (AI) and so on. Consequently, this work proposes a hybrid method using Prophet and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to overcome the above limitations in an effort to predict accurate load. The Prophet model utilize linear as well as non-linear data to predict original load data but still some of the residuals are left which are regarded as non-linear data. Here, these residuals (non-linear data) are trained by employing LSTM, and finally both the forecasted data from Prophet and LSTM are trained by Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) to further enhance prediction accuracy. Elia Grid real time quarter hour based electrical load data from 2014 to 2021 has been utilized to verify working performance of proposed hybrid technique by computing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Average Error (MAE). Results substantiate that proposed hybrid models outperforms the standalone models of Autoregressive Integrated Moving average (ARIMA), LSTM and Prophet model on the basis of reduced errors with least computation time.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of computer science that focuses on the development of machines that operate like humans. In the field of AI, medical disease detection is an instantly growing domain of research. In the past years, numerous endeavours have been made for the improvements of medical disease detection, because the errors and problems in medical disease detection cause serious wrong medical treatment. Meta-heuristic techniques have been frequently utilized for the detection of medical diseases and promise better accuracy of perception and prediction of diseases in the domain of biomedical. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm-based intelligent stochastic search technique encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm during the searching of their food source. Consequently, for the versatility of numerical experimentation, PSO has been mostly applied to address the diverse kinds of optimization problems. However, the PSO techniques are frequently adopted for the detection of diseases but there is still a gap in the comparative survey. This paper presents an insight into the diagnosis of medical diseases in health care using various PSO approaches. This study presents to deliver a systematic literature review of current PSO approaches for knowledge discovery in the field of disease detection. The systematic analysis discloses the potential research areas of PSO strategies as well as the research gaps, although, the main goal is to provide the directions for future enhancement and development in this area. This paper gives a systematic survey of this conceptual model for the advanced research, which has been explored in the specified literature to date. This review comprehends the fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and conventional application fields. It is predicted that our study will be beneficial for the researchers to review the PSO algorithms in-depth for disease detection. Several challenges that can be undertaken to move the field forward are discussed according to the current state of the PSO strategies in health care.

AB The recent global outbreak and spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) makes it an imperative to develop accurate and efficient diagnostic tools for the disease as medical resources are getting increasingly constrained. Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information. An online CT-based diagnostic platform for COVID-19 derived from our proposed framework is now available. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The built environment is found to relate to running behaviors. However, the impacts of the street environment on running were less addressed due to the lack of running data in large geospatial urban regions, while the potential of semi-open data sources like Strava Heatmap for running studies is rarely verified. Moreover, how objective features and the subjective perceptions of the street environment are related to running is still largely unknown. We hypothesize that the eye-level subjective and objective streetscapes may complement the macro-scale built environment factors to better inform running amount prediction. Therefore, we evaluated the associations between running and street attributes by applying multi-sourced data, street view imagery (SVI) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, taking Boston as an example. We found that, first, the street environment is significantly correlated with running. Accounting for the spatial effects, the collective strength of street attributes was almost the same as the counterpart of the built environment, validating the value of including subjective and objective streetscapes measures in running studies. Second, street factors can complement built environment factors, indicating the necessity of using both macro-scale and eye-level environmental features to interpret running. Third, in addition to higher accessibility and more public transportation, the safer, wider and relatively open streets with more natural views, street lights, amenities and furniture, could promote running, while the enclosed environment, dense and overwhelming buildings, excessive interruptions on streets might hinder running. Our study provides an important example of using semi-open running data and integrating multi-sourced data and AI to bring new insights into running and urban environment studies. The findings could provide instructive suggestions for the establishment of a running-friendly urban environment and ultimately help to improve public health.

AB Objectives: This study utilised an Artificial Intelligence (AI) method, namely 3D-Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (3D-DCGAN), which is one of the true 3D machine learning methods, as an automatic algorithm to design a dental crown.Methods: Six hundred sets of digital casts containing mandibular second premolars and their adjacent and antagonist teeth obtained from healthy personnel were machine -learned using 3D-DCGAN. Additional 12 sets of data were used as the test dataset, whereas the natural second premolars in the test dataset were compared with the designs in (1) 3D-DCGAN, (2) CEREC Biogeneric, and (3) CAD for morphological parameters of 3D similarity, cusp angle, occlusal contact point number and area, and in silico fatigue simulations with finite element (FE) using lithium disilicate material.Results: The 3D-DCGAN design and natural teeth had the lowest discrepancy in mor-phology compared with the other groups (root mean square value = 0.3611). The Biogeneric design showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher cusp angle (67.11 degrees) than that of the 3D-DCGAN design (49.43 degrees) and natural tooth (54.05 degrees). No significant difference was observed in the number and area of occlusal contact points among the four groups. FE analysis showed that the 3D-DCGAN design had the best match to the natural tooth regarding the stress distribution in the crown. The 3D-DCGAN design was subjected to 26.73 MPa and the natural tooth was subjected to 23.97 MPa stress at the central fossa area under physiolo-gical occlusal force (300 N); the two groups showed similar fatigue lifetimes (F-N curve) under simulated cyclic loading of 100-400 N. Designs with Biogeneric or technician would yield respectively higher or lower fatigue lifetime than natural teeth.Significance: This study demonstrated that 3D-DCGAN could be utilised to design perso-nalised dental crowns with high accuracy that can mimic both the morphology and bio-mechanics of natural teeth.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Optimal performance is desired for decision-making in any field with binary classifiers and diagnostic tests, however common performance measures lack depth in information. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the area under the precision recall curve are too general because they evaluate all decision thresholds including unrealistic ones. Conversely, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the F1 score are too specific-they are measured at a single threshold that is optimal for some instances, but not others, which is not equitable. In between both approaches, we propose deep ROC analysis to measure performance in multiple groups of predicted risk (like calibration), or groups of true positive rate or false positive rate. In each group, we measure the group AUC (properly), normalized group AUC, and averages of: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio positive and negative. The measurements can be compared between groups, to whole measures, to point measures and between models. We also provide a new interpretation of AUC in whole or part, as balanced average accuracy, relevant to individuals instead of pairs. We evaluate models in three case studies using our method and Python toolkit and confirm its utility.

AB Clinical workflows in oncology rely on predictive and prognostic molecular biomarkers. However, the growing number of these complex biomarkers tends to increase the cost and time for decision-making in routine daily oncology practice; furthermore, biomarkers often require tumour tissue on top of routine diagnostic material. Nevertheless, routinely available tumour tissue contains an abundance of clinically relevant information that is currently not fully exploited. Advances in deep learning (DL), an artificial intelligence (AI) technology, have enabled the extraction of previously hidden information directly from routine histology images of cancer, providing potentially clinically useful information. Here, we outline emerging concepts of how DL can extract biomarkers directly from histology images and summarise studies of basic and advanced image analysis for cancer histology. Basic image analysis tasks include detection, grading and subtyping of tumour tissue in histology images; they are aimed at automating pathology workflows and consequently do not immediately translate into clinical decisions. Exceeding such basic approaches, DL has also been used for advanced image analysis tasks, which have the potential of directly affecting clinical decision-making processes. These advanced approaches include inference of molecular features, prediction of survival and end-to-end prediction of therapy response. Predictions made by such DL systems could simplify and enrich clinical decision-making, but require rigorous external validation in clinical settings.

AB Chronic wounds in diabetic patients are challenging because their prolonged inflammation makes healing difficult, thus burdening patients, society, and health care systems. Customized dressing materials are needed to effectively treat such wounds that vary in shape and depth. The continuous development of 3D-printing technology along with artificial intelligence has increased the precision, versatility, and compatibility of various materials, thus providing the considerable potential to meet the abovementioned needs. Herein, functional 3D-printing inks comprising DNA from salmon sperm and DNA-induced biosilica inspired by marine sponges, are developed for the machine learning-based 3D-printing of wound dressings. The DNA and biomineralized silica are incorporated into hydrogel inks in a fast, facile manner. The 3D-printed wound dressing thus generates provided appropriate porosity, characterized by effective exudate and blood absorption at wound sites, and mechanical tunability indicated by good shape fidelity and printability during optimized 3D printing. Moreover, the DNA and biomineralized silica act as nanotherapeutics, enhancing the biological activity of the dressings in terms of reactive oxygen species scavenging, angiogenesis, and anti-inflammation activity, thereby accelerating acute and diabetic wound healing. These bioinspired 3D-printed hydrogels produce using a DNA-induced biomineralization strategy are an excellent functional platform for clinical applications in acute and chronic wound repair.

AB Background: ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has gained popularity for its ability to generate human-like responses. It is essential to note that overreliance or blind trust in ChatGPT, especially in high-stakes decision-making contexts, can have severe consequences. Similarly, lacking trust in the technology can lead to underuse, resulting in missed opportunities. Objective: This study investigated the impact of users' trust in ChatGPT on their intent and actual use of the technology. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) users' intent to use ChatGPT increases with their trust in the technology; (2) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users' intent to use the technology; (3) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users' trust in the technology; and (4) users' intent to use ChatGPT can partially mediate the effect of trust in the technology on its actual use. Methods: This study distributed a web-based survey to adults in the United States who actively use ChatGPT (version 3.5) at least once a month between February 2023 through March 2023. The survey responses were used to develop 2 latent constructs: Trust and Intent to Use , with Actual Use being the outcome variable. The study used partial least squares structural equation modeling to evaluate and test the structural model and hypotheses. Results: In the study, 607 respondents completed the survey. The primary uses of ChatGPT were for information gathering (n=219, 36.1%), entertainment (n=203, 33.4%), and problem-solving (n=135, 22.2%), with a smaller number using it for health-related queries (n=44, 7.2%) and other activities (n=6, 1%). Our model explained 50.5% and 9.8% of the variance in Intent to Use and Actual Use , respectively, with path coefficients of 0.711 and 0.221 for Trust on Intent to Use and Actual Use, respectively. The bootstrapped results failed to reject all 4 null hypotheses, with Trust having a significant direct effect on both Intent to Use (beta=0.711, 95% CI 0.656-0.764) and Actual Use (beta=0.302, 95% CI 0.229-0.374). The indirect effect of Trust on Actual Use , partially mediated by Intent to Use , was also significant (beta=0.113, 95% CI 0.001-0.227). Conclusions: Our results suggest that trust is critical to users' adoption of ChatGPT. It remains crucial to highlight that ChatGPT was not initially designed for health care applications. Therefore, an overreliance on it for health-related advice could potentially lead to misinformation and subsequent health risks. Efforts must be focused on improving the ChatGPT's ability to distinguish between queries that it can safely handle and those that should be redirected to human experts (health care professionals). Although risks are associated with excessive trust in artificial intelligence-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT, the potential risks can be reduced by advocating for shared accountability and fostering collaboration between developers, subject matter experts, and human factors researchers.

AB Deep learning (DL) has great influence on large parts of science and increasingly established itself as an adaptive method for new challenges in the field of Earth observation (EO). Nevertheless, the entry barriers for EO researchers are high due to the dense and rapidly developing field mainly driven by advances in computer vision (CV). To lower the barriers for researchers in EO, this review gives an overview of the evolution of DL with a focus on image segmentation and object detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The survey starts in 2012, when a CNN set new standards in image recognition, and lasts until late 2019. Thereby, we highlight the connections between the most important CNN architectures and cornerstones coming from CV in order to alleviate the evaluation of modern DL models. Furthermore, we briefly outline the evolution of the most popular DL frameworks and provide a summary of datasets in EO. By discussing well performing DL architectures on these datasets as well as reflecting on advances made in CV and their impact on future research in EO, we narrow the gap between the reviewed, theoretical concepts from CV and practical application in EO.

AB This study investigates whether social-versus task-oriented interaction of virtual shopping assistants differentially benefits low versus high Internet competency older consumers with respect to social (perceived interactivity, trust), cognitive (perceived information load), functional (self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness), and behavioral intent (website patronage intent) outcomes in an online shopping task. A total of 121 older adults (61-89 years) participated in a laboratory experiment with a 2 (digital assistant interaction style: (social-vs. task-oriented) x 2 (user Internet competency: low vs. high) x 2 (user exchange modality: text vs. voice) between-subjects design. The results revealed that users Internet competency and the digital assistant's conversational style had significant interaction effects on social, functional, and behavioral intent outcomes. Social-oriented digital assistants lead to superior social outcomes (enhanced perceptions of two-way interactivity and trust in the integrity of the site) for older users with high Internet competency, who need less task-related assistance. On the other hand, low-competency older users showed significantly superior cognitive (lower perceived information load) and functional outcomes (greater perceived ease and self-efficacy of using the site) when the digital assistant employed a task-oriented interaction style. Theoretical and agent design implications are discussed.

AB People can store their data on servers in cloud computing and allow public users to access data via data centers. One of the most difficult tasks is to provide security for the access policy of data, which is also needed to be stored at cloud servers. The access structure (policy) itself may reveal partial information about what the ciphertext contains. To provide security for the access policy of data, a number of encryption schemes are available. Among these, CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) scheme is very significant because it helps to protect, broadcast, and control the access of information. The access policy that is sent as plaintext in the existing CP-ABE scheme along with a ciphertext may leak user privacy and data privacy. To resolve this problem, we hereby introduce a new technique, which hides the access policy using a hashing algorithm and provides security against insider attack using a signature verification scheme. The proposed system is compared with existing CP-ABE schemes in terms of computation and expressive policies. In addition, we can test the functioning of any access control that could be implemented in the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, security against indistinguishable adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks is also analyzed for the proposed work.

AB With the advance of 5G technologies by both academia and industry, 5G adoption is gaining widespread acceptance in numerous cities, prompting further innovations in Smart City technologies riding on the wave of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, even in its infancy stage, the speed of technological advancement is already highlighting the limitations of 5G, and its potentially short lifespan as new technologies are rendered obsolete faster. This fast-moving field is coupled with an ongoing and increasing funding into Research & Development (R&D) efforts by private corporations, to potentially commercialise on the surge in demand for `smarter' cities', This paper aims to chart the major directions and scope emerging dimensions inherent to 6G technology, including Digital Twins and Immersive Realities (XR) that, when applied to cities that are currently being equipped with digital infrastructural backbones, may have direct socio-economic impacts upon our lives while responding to the tenets of the Sustainable Development Goal 11. Looking at the future 6G technology this article considers the prospects of 6G, and its associated concepts, and its relations as they pertain to Future, Smart, Digital and Sustainable Cities.

AB Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa, Siri and Google Assistants are examples of Voice-based digital assistants (VBDA) that are ubiquitously occupying our living spaces. While they gather an enormous amount of personal information to provide bespoke user experience, they also evoke serious privacy concerns regarding the collection, use and storage of personal data of the consumers. The objective of this research is to examine the perception of the consumers towards the privacy concerns and in turn its influence on the adoption of VBDA. We extend the celebrated UTAUT2 model with perceived privacy concerns, perceived privacy risk and perceived trust. With the assistance of survey data collected from tech-savvy respondents, we show that trust in technology and the service provider plays an important role in the adoption of VBDA. In addition, we notice that consumers showcase a trade-off between privacy risks and benefits associated with VBDA while adopting the VBDA such technologies, reiterating their calculus behaviour. Contrary to the extant literature, our results indicate that consumers? perceived privacy risk does not influence adoption intention directly. It is mediated through perceived privacy concerns and consumers? trust. Then, we propose theoretical and managerial implications to conclude the paper.

AB To leverage rich data distributed at the network edge, a new machine-learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged where learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing intelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, federated edge learning (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated "over-the-air" by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such broadband analog aggregation (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control ("truncated channel inversion") required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rise to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning. Next, the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA with respect to the traditional OFDMA scheme is proved to scale almost linearly with the device population. Experiments based on a neural network and a real dataset are conducted for corroborating the theoretical results.

AB Background Coronary inflammation induces dynamic changes in the balance between water and lipid content in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), as captured by perivascular Fat Attenuation Index (FAI) in standard coronary CT angiography (CCTA). However, inflammation is not the only process involved in atherogenesis and we hypothesized that additional radiomic signatures of adverse fibrotic and microvascular PVAT remodelling, may further improve cardiac risk prediction.
   Methods and results We present a new artificial intelligence-powered method to predict cardiac risk by analysing the radiomic profile of coronary PVAT, developed and validated in patient cohorts acquired in three different studies. In Study 1, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 167 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and the expression of genes representing inflammation, fibrosis and vascularity was linked with the radiomic features extracted from tissue CT images. Adipose tissue wavelet-transformed mean attenuation (captured by FAI) was the most sensitive radiomic feature in describing tissue inflammation (TNFA expression), while features of radiomic texture were related to adipose tissue fibrosis (COL1A1 expression) and vascularity (CD31 expression). In Study 2, we analysed 1391 coronary PVAT radiomic features in 101 patients who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 5years of having a CCTA and 101 matched controls, training and validating a machine learning (random forest) algorithm (fat radiomic profile, FRP) to discriminate cases from controls (C-statistic 0.77 [95%CI: 0.62-0.93] in the external validation set). The coronary FRP signature was then tested in 1575 consecutive eligible participants in the SCOT-HEART trial, where it significantly improved MACE prediction beyond traditional risk stratification that included risk factors, coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, and high-risk plaque features on CCTA (Delta[C-statistic] = 0.126, P<0.001). In Study 3, FRP was significantly higher in 44 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction compared with 44 matched controls, but unlike FAI, remained unchanged 6 months after the index event, confirming that FRP detects persistent PVAT changes not captured by FAI.
   Conclusion The CCTA-based radiomic profiling of coronary artery PVAT detects perivascular structural remodelling associated with coronary artery disease, beyond inflammation. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging biomarker (FRP) leads to a striking improvement of cardiac risk prediction over and above the current state-of-the-art.

AB The Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) is an emerging concept aiming to perceive, understand and connect the 'intelligent things' to make the intercommunication of various networks and systems more efficient. A key step in achieving this goal is to carry out high-precision data analysis at the edge and cloud level. Clustering and dimensionality reduction in AIoT can facilitate efficient data management, storage, computing, and transmission of various data-driven AIoT applications. For high-efficiency data clustering and dimensionality reduction, this paper develops a prior-dependent graph (PDG) construction method to model and discover the complex relations of data. With the proper utilization and incorporation of data priors, i.e., (a) element local sparsity; (b) pair-wise symmetry; (c) multi-instance manifold smoothness; and (d) matrix low-rankness, the obtained graph has the characteristics of local sparsity, symmetry, low-rank, and can well reveal the complex multi-instance proximity among data points. The developed PDG model is then applied for two typical data analysis tasks, i.e., unsupervised data clustering and dimensionality reduction. Experimental results on multiple benchmark databases verify that, compared with some existing graph learning models, the PDG model can achieve substantial performance, which can be deployed in edge computing modules to provide efficient solutions for massive data management and applications in AIoT.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21(st) century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

AB The virtual world created by the development of the Internet, computers, artificial intelligence (AI), and hardware technologies have brought various degrees of digital transformation to people's lives. With multiple demands for virtual reality increasing, the metaverse, a new type of social ecology that can connect the physical and virtual worlds, is booming. However, with the rapid growth of data volume and value, the continuous evolution of the metaverse faces the demands and challenges of privacy, security, high synchronization, and low latency. Fortunately, the ever-evolving blockchain and intelligent networking technologies can be used to satisfy the trusted construction, continuous data interaction, and computing demands of the metaverse. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth review of the role and gains of blockchain, intelligent networking, and the combination of both in providing the immersive experiences of the metaverse. In this survey, we first discuss the development trend, characteristics, and architecture of the metaverse. Then, the existing work on blockchain, networking, and the combination of the two technologies are reviewed, including overviews, applications, and challenges. Next, applications of the metaverse are summarized, emphasizing the importance of the metaverse and the fields of development. Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and future research directions.

AB As an enabler for smart industrial Internet of Things (IoT), sensor cloud facilitates data collection, processing, analysis, storage, and sharing on demand. However, compromised or malicious sensor nodes may cause the collected data to be invalid or even endanger the normal operation of an entire IoT system. Therefore, designing an effective mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness of sensor nodes is a critical issue. However, existing cloud computing models cannot provide direct and effective management for the sensor nodes. Meanwhile, the insufficient computation and storage ability of sensor nodes makes them incapable of performing complex intelligent algorithms. To this end, mobile edge nodes with relatively strong computation and storage ability are exploited to provide intelligent trust evaluation and management for sensor nodes. In this article, a mobile edge computing-based intelligent trust evaluation scheme is proposed to comprehensively evaluate the trustworthiness of sensor nodes using probabilistic graphical model. The proposed mechanism evaluates the trustworthiness of sensor nodes from data collection and communication behavior. Moreover, the moving path for the edge nodes is scheduled to improve the probability of direct trust evaluation and decrease the moving distance. An approximation algorithm with provable performance is designed. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively ensure the trustworthiness of sensor nodes and decrease the energy consumption.

AB The superior multi-functional properties of polymer composites have made them an ideal choice for aerospace, automobile, marine, civil, and many other technologically demanding industries. The increasing demand of these composites calls for an extensive investigation of their physical, chemical and mechanical behavior under different exposure conditions. Machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a powerful predictive tool for data-driven multi-physical modeling, leading to unprecedented insights and exploration of the system properties beyond the capability of traditional computational and experimental analyses. Here we aim to abridge the findings of the large volume of relevant literature and highlight the broad spectrum potential of ML in applications like prediction, optimization, feature identification, uncertainty quantification, reliability and sensitivity analysis along with the framework of different ML algorithms concerning polymer composites. Challenges like the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, noise and mixed variable problems are discussed, including the latest advancements in ML that have the potential to be integrated in the field of polymer composites. Based on the extensive literature survey, a few recommendations on the exploitation of various ML algorithms for addressing different critical problems concerning polymer composites are provided along with insightful perspectives on the potential directions of future research.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that makes people's lives smart by conquering a plethora of diverse application and service areas. In near future, the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks provide the connectivity for this IoT ecosystem. It has been carefully designed to facilitate the exponential growth in the IoT field. Network slicing is one of the key technologies in the 5G architecture that has the ability to divide the physical network into multiple logical networks (i.e., slices) with different network characteristics. Therefore, network slicing is also a key enabler of realisation of IoT in 5G. Network slicing can satisfy the various networking demands by heterogeneous IoT applications via dedicated slices. In this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of the exploitation of network slicing in IoT realisation. We discuss network slicing utilisation in different IoT application scenarios, along with the technical challenges that can be solved via network slicing. Furthermore, integration challenges and open research problems related to the network slicing in the IoT realisation are also discussed in this paper. Finally, we discuss the role of other emerging technologies and concepts, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in network slicing and IoT integration.

   intelligence; toxic speech; copyright
AB As government pressure on major technology companies builds, both firms and legislators are searching for technical solutions to difficult platform governance puzzles such as hate speech and misinformation. Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools - what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems - are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale by major platforms for user-generated content such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This article provides an accessible technical primer on how algorithmic moderation works; examines some of the existing automated tools used by major platforms to handle copyright infringement, terrorism and toxic speech; and identifies key political and ethical issues for these systems as the reliance on them grows. Recent events suggest that algorithmic moderation has become necessary to manage growing public expectations for increased platform responsibility, safety and security on the global stage; however, as we demonstrate, these systems remain opaque, unaccountable and poorly understood. Despite the potential promise of algorithms or 'AI', we show that even 'well optimized' moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems with content policy as enacted by platforms for three main reasons: automated moderation threatens to (a) further increase opacity, making a famously non-transparent set of practices even more difficult to understand or audit, (b) further complicate outstanding issues of fairness and justice in large-scale sociotechnical systems and (c) re-obscure the fundamentally political nature of speech decisions being executed at scale.

TI Novel deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis system for predicting
   inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis
SO GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
LA English
DT Article
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; VALIDATION; TIME
AB Background and Aims: Endoscopy is increasingly performed for evaluating patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, its diagnostic accuracy is largely affected by the subjectivity of endoscopists' experience and scoring methods, and scoring of selected endoscopic images cannot reflect the inflammation of the entire intestine. We aimed to develop an automatic scoring system using deep-learning technology for consistent and objective scoring of endoscopic images and full-length endoscopic videos of patients with UC.
   Methods: We collected 5875 endoscopic images and 20 full-length videos from 332 patients with UC who under-went colonoscopy between January 2017 and March 2021. We trained the artificial intelligence (AI) scoring system using these images, which was then used for full-length video scoring. To more accurately assess and visualize the full-length intestinal inflammation, we divided the large intestine into a fixed number of "areas" (cecum, 20; trans-verse colon, 20; descending colon, 20; sigmoid colon, 15; rectum, 10). The scoring system automatically scored inflammatory severity of 85 areas from every video and generated a visualized result of full-length intestinal inflam-matory activity.
   Results: Compared with endoscopist scoring, the trained convolutional neural network achieved 86.54% accu-racy in the Mayo-scored task, whereas the kappa coefficient was .813 (95% confidence interval [CI], .782-.844). The metrics of the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity-scored task were encouraging, with accuracies of 90.7%, 84.6%, and 77.7% and kappa coefficients of .822 (95% CI, .788-.855), .784 (95% CI, .744-.823), and .702 (95% CI, .612-.793) for vascular pattern, erosions and ulcers, and bleeding, respectively. The AI scoring system predicted each bowel segment's score and displayed distribution of inflammatory activity in the entire large in-testine using a 2-dimensional colorized image.
   Conclusions: We established a novel deep learning-based scoring system to evaluate endoscopic images from patients with UC, which can also accurately describe the severity and distribution of inflammatory activity through full-length intestinal endoscopic videos.

AB The introduction of machine learning (ML) in organizations comes with the claim that algorithms will produce insights superior to those of experts by discovering the "truth" from data. Such a claim gives rise to a tension between the need to produce knowledge independent of domain experts and the need to remain relevant to the domain the system serves. This two-year ethnographic study focuses on how developers managed this tension when building an ML system to support the process of hiring job candidates at a large international organization. Despite the initial goal of getting domain experts "out the loop," we found that developers and experts arrived at a new hybrid practice that relied on a combination of ML and domain expertise. We explain this outcome as resulting from a process of mutual learning in which deep engagement with the technology triggered actors to reflect on how they produced knowledge. These reflections prompted the developers to iterate between excluding domain expertise from the ML system and including it. Contrary to common views that imply an opposition between ML and domain expertise, our study foregrounds their interdependence and as such shows the dialectic nature of developing ML. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for the literature on information technologies and knowledge work, information system development and implementation, and human-ML hybrids.

AB Landslides are among the most devastating natural hazards, severely impacting human lives and damaging property and infrastructure. Landslide susceptibility maps, which help to identify which regions in a given area are at greater risk of a landslide occurring, are a key tool for effective mitigation. Research in this field has grown immensely, ranging from quantitative to deterministic approaches, with a recent surge in machine learning (ML)-based computational models. The development of ML models, in particular, has undergone a meteoritic rise in the last decade, contributing to the successful development of accurate susceptibility maps. However, despite their success, these models are rarely used by stakeholders owing to their "black box"nature. Hence, it is crucial to explain the results, thus providing greater transparency for the use of such models. To address this gap, the present work introduces the use of an ML-based explainable algorithm, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for landslide susceptibility modeling. A convolutional neural network model was used conducted in the CheongJu region in South Korea. A total of 519 landslide locations were examined with 16 landslideaffected variables, of which 70% was used for training and 30% for testing, and the model achieved an accuracy of 89%. Further, the comparison was performed using Support Vector Machine mode, which achieved an accuracy of 84%. The SHAP plots showed variations in feature interactions for both landslide and non-landslide locations, thus providing more clarity as to how the model achieves a specific result. The SHAP dependence plots explained the relationship between altitude and slope, showing a negative relationship with altitude and a positive relationship with slope. This is the first use of an explainable ML model in landslide susceptibility modeling, and we argue that future works should include aspects of explainability to open up the possibility of developing a transferable artificial intelligence model. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB BackgroundForests are an essential natural resource to humankind, providing a myriad of direct and indirect benefits. Natural disasters like forest fires have a major impact on global warming and the continued existence of life on Earth. Automatic identification of forest fires is thus an important field to research in order to minimize disasters. Early fire detection can also help decision-makers plan mitigation methods and extinguishing tactics. This research looks at fire/smoke detection from images using AI-based computer vision techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach that have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in image classification and other computer vision tasks, but their training time can be prohibitive. Further, a pretrained CNN may underperform when there is no sufficient dataset available. To address this issue, transfer learning is exercised on pre-trained models. However, the models may lose their classification abilities on the original datasets when transfer learning is applied. To solve this problem, we use learning without forgetting (LwF), which trains the network with a new task but keeps the network's preexisting abilities intact.ResultsIn this study, we implement transfer learning on pre-trained models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception, which allow us to work with a smaller dataset and lessen the computational complexity without degrading accuracy. Of all the models, Xception excelled with 98.72% accuracy. We tested the performance of the proposed models with and without LwF. Without LwF, among all the proposed models, Xception gave an accuracy of 79.23% on a new task (BowFire dataset). While using LwF, Xception gave an accuracy of 91.41% for the BowFire dataset and 96.89% for the original dataset. We find that fine-tuning the new task with LwF performed comparatively well on the original dataset.ConclusionBased on the experimental findings, it is found that the proposed models outperform the current state-of-the-art methods. We also show that LwF can successfully categorize novel and unseen datasets.

AB The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca, Regeneron mAb cocktail, Celltrion, and Rockefeller University. However, its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline's sotrovimab appear to be mild. Our work calls for new strategies to develop the next generation mutation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibodies.

ID BUILDING ENERGY; MODEL; SYSTEM; POWER
AB With the rapid advancement of the high-performance computing technology and the increasing availability of the mass-storage memory device, the application of the data-driven models (e.g., the artificial neural network (ANN) model) for solar radiation prediction is appearing in abundance in the past decade. Although the performances of these models have been discussed in a large number of studies, how to further enhance the forecasting accuracies of these data-driven approaches to better facilitate the advanced controls in the building system such as model predictive control (MPC) in smart buildings remains a challenge. Deep learning, which is considered as a powerful tool to move machine learning closer to one of its original goals, i.e., Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a viable solution to this problem.
   In this study, an ANN model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model are developed to investigate the performances of the deep learning algorithms for the solar radiation prediction. The actual meteorological data (AMY) from a local weather station in Alabama is used for the training process. Various scenarios, including different sampling frequencies and moving window algorithms, are included for a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracies and efficiencies. The results suggest that compared with the ANN model, the solar radiation prediction using the RNN model has a higher prediction accuracy, with a 47% improvement in Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE) and a 26% improvement in Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE). Besides, this forecasting accuracy could even be taken to a higher level by increasing the granularity of the data or adding a moving-window algorithm to the prediction model. By increasing the sampling frequency of the training data from 1 h to 10 min, the Root-Coefficient of Variation Mean-Squared Error (CV(RMSE)) of the ANN model dropped from 30.9% to 9.41%, while the CV(RMSE) of the RNN model dropped from 9.83% to 7.64%. For the RNN model, the NMBE was improved from 0.9% to 0.2% after the implementation of the moving-window algorithm. Besides, it was found that the cloud cover could have a significant impact on the prediction accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Performance of ChatGPT on the Plastic Surgery Inservice Training
   Examination
SO AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Background Developed originally as a tool for resident self-evaluation, the Plastic Surgery Inservice Training Examination (PSITE) has become a standardized tool adopted by Plastic Surgery residency programs. The introduction of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), has demonstrated the potential to help propel the field of Plastic Surgery. Objectives The authors of this study wanted to assess whether or not ChatGPT could be utilized as a tool in resident education by assessing its accuracy on the PSITE. Methods Questions were obtained from the 2022 PSITE, which was present on the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) website. Questions containing images or tables were carefully inspected and flagged before being inputted into ChatGPT. All responses by ChatGPT were qualified utilizing the properties of natural coherence. Responses that were found to be incorrect were divided into the following categories: logical, informational, or explicit fallacy. Results ChatGPT answered a total of 242 questions with an accuracy of 54.96%. The software incorporated logical reasoning in 88.8% of questions, internal information in 95.5% of questions, and external information in 92.1% of questions. When stratified by correct and incorrect responses, we determined that there was a statistically significant difference in ChatGPT's use of external information (P < .05). Conclusions ChatGPT is a versatile tool that has the potential to impact resident education by providing general knowledge, clarifying information, providing case-based learning, and promoting evidence-based medicine. With advancements in LLM and artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible that ChatGPT may be an impactful tool for resident education within Plastic Surgery.

AB Omni-channel retailing is a popular strategy in a new retailing era when digitalization, social media, big data and other emerging technologies (e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, etc.) are transforming the retail business models. Meanwhile, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge on either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make "right" decisions to fit in the new retail environment. This review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omni-channel retailing literature, generate managerial implications for firms, and provides a guideline for future research. We conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis (CNA). The CNA helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains, which depict (or constitute) a whole picture of "omnichannel management". The main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study. We also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the "omnichannel management". Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review. Therefore, we propose a prescribed framework for "omnichannel management" (PFOM), which contributes to the literature on "omnichannel management" and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has made a significant impact on various supply chains (SCs). All around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic affects different dimensions of SCs, including but not limited to finance, lead time, demand changes, and production performance. There is an urgent need to respond to this grand challenge. The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted scholars to develop innovative SC disruption management strategies and disseminate them via numerous scientific articles. However, there is still a lack of systematic literature survey studies that aim to identify promising SC disruption management strategies through the bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses. In order to address this drawback, this study presents a set of upto-date bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses to identify the influential contributors, main research streams, and disruption management strategies related to the SC performance under the COVID-19 settings. The conducted analyses reveal that resilience and sustainability are the primary SC topics. Furthermore, the major research themes are found to be food, health-related SCs, and technology-aided tools (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and blockchains). Various disruption management strategies focusing on resilience and sustainability themes are extracted from the most influential studies that were identified as a part of this work. In addition, we draw some managerial insights to ensure a resilient and sustainable supply of critical products in the event of a pandemic, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and vaccines.

AB Objective The effect of colonoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality is limited by several factors, among them a certain miss rate, leading to limited adenoma detection rates (ADRs). We investigated the effect of an automatic polyp detection system based on deep learning on polyp detection rate and ADR.
   Design In an open, non-blinded trial, consecutive patients were prospectively randomised to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy with or without assistance of a real-time automatic polyp detection system providing a simultaneous visual notice and sound alarm on polyp detection. The primary outcome was ADR.
   Results Of 1058 patients included, 536 were randomised to standard colonoscopy, and 522 were randomised to colonoscopy with computer-aided diagnosis. The artificial intelligence (AI) system significantly increased ADR (29.1%vs20.3%, p<0.001) and the mean number of adenomas per patient (0.53vs0.31, p<0.001). This was due to a higher number of diminutive adenomas found (185vs102; p<0.001), while there was no statistical difference in larger adenomas (77vs58, p=0.075). In addition, the number of hyperplastic polyps was also significantly increased (114vs52, p<0.001).
   Conclusions In a low prevalent ADR population, an automatic polyp detection system during colonoscopy resulted in a significant increase in the number of diminutive adenomas detected, as well as an increase in the rate of hyperplastic polyps. The cost-benefit ratio of such effects has to be determined further.

AB Simple Summary This study develops an arithmetic optimization algorithm with deep-learning-based histopathological breast cancer classification (AOADL-HBCC) technique for healthcare decision making. The AOADL-HBCC technique employs noise removal based on median filtering (MF) and a contrast enhancement process. In addition, the presented AOADL-HBCC technique applies an AOA with a SqueezeNet model to derive feature vectors. Finally, a deep belief network (DBN) classifier with an Adamax hyperparameter optimizer is applied for the breast cancer classification process. Histopathological images are commonly used imaging modalities for breast cancer. As manual analysis of histopathological images is difficult, automated tools utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods should be modelled. The recent advancements in DL approaches will be helpful in establishing maximal image classification performance in numerous application zones.

AB Existing public health emergencies due to fatal/infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and monkeypox have raised the paradigm of 5th generation portable intelligent and multifunctional biosensors embedded on a single chip. The state-of-the-art 5th generation biosensors are concerned with integrating advanced functional materials with controllable physicochemical attributes and optimal machine processability. In this direction, 2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), owing to their enhanced effective surface area, tunable physicochemical properties, and rich surface functionalities, have shown promising performances in biosensing flatlands. Moreover, their hybridization with diversified nanomaterials caters to their associated challenges for the commercialization of stability due to restacking and oxidation. MXenes and its hybrid bio-sensors have demonstrated intelligent and lab-on-chip prospects for determining diverse biomarkers/pathogens related to fatal and infectious diseases. Recently, on-site detection has been clubbed with solution-on-chip MXenes by interfacing biosensors with modern-age technologies, including 5G communication, internet-of-medical-things (IoMT), artificial intelligence (AI), and data clouding to progress toward hospital-on-chip (HOC) modules. This review comprehensively summarizes the state-of-the-art MXene fabrication, advance-ments in physicochemical properties to architect biosensors, and the progress of MXene-based lab-on-chip bio-sensors toward HOC solutions. Besides, it discusses sustainable aspects, practical challenges and alternative solutions associated with these modules to develop personalized and remote healthcare solutions for every in-dividual in the world.

AB The concept of Fake Media or Internet of Fake Media Things (IoFMT) has emerged in different domains of digital society such as politics, news, and social media. Due to the integrity of the media being compromised quite frequently, revolutionary changes must be taken to avoid further and more widespread IoFMT. With today's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), such compromises may be profoundly limited. Providing proof of authenticity to outline the authorship and integrity for digital content has been a pressing need. Blockchain, a promising new decentralized secure platform, has been advocated to help combat the authenticity aspect of fake media in a context where resistance to the modification of data is important. Although some methods around blockchain have been proposed to take on authentication problems, most current studies are built on unrealistic assumptions with the after-the-incident type of mechanisms. In this article, we propose a preventative approach using a novel blockchainbased solution suited for IoFMT incorporated with a gamification component. More specifically, the proposed approach uses concepts of a customized Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm, along with a weighted-ranking algorithm, serving as an incentive mechanism in the gamification component to determine the integrity of fake news. Although our approach focuses on fake news, the framework could be very well extended for other types of digital content as well. A proof of concept implementation is developed to outline the advantage of the proposed solution.

ID JOINT COMPUTATION
AB With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), there is an increasing demand for deploying various intelligent applications on vehicles. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is receiving extensive attention from both the industry and academia due to its benefits from the edge computing paradigm, which pushes computing tasks from the core of the network to the edge of the network. However, in the VEC environment considering vehicles to Road Side Units (RSUs), due to the mobility of vehicles, it is still a challenge to make dynamic and efficient offloading decisions for compute-intensive tasks, especially in the congestion situation. In order to minimize the total delay and waiting time of tasks from moving vehicles, we establish a dynamic offloading model for multiple moving vehicles whose tasks can be divided into sequential subtasks, so that the offloading decisions are more refined. Moreover, the proposed model is frame-based to avoid unnecessary waiting time, which makes offloading decisions when the subtasks of each vehicle are generated rather than offloading subtasks after gathering subtasks of vehicles for a time slot. Aiming to find the optimal offloading decision for sequential subtasks, we propose a Dynamic Framing Offloading algorithm based on Double Deep Q-Network (DFO-DDQN). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DFO-DDQN when compared with other DRL-based methods and greedy-based methods.

AB In recent years, the fourth industrial revolution has attracted attention worldwide. Several concepts were born in conjunction with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance. This study aims to investigate academic advances in failure prediction. The prediction of failures takes into account concepts as a predictive maintenance decision support system and a design support system. We focus on frameworks that use machine learning and reasoning for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0. More specifically, we consider the challenges in the application of machine learning techniques and ontologies in the context of predictive maintenance. We conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2015 until the beginning of June 2020. The screening process resulted in a final population of 38 studies of a total of 562 analyzed. We removed papers not directly related to predictive maintenance, machine learning, as well as researches classified as surveys or reviews. We discuss the proposals and results of these papers, considering three research questions. This article contributes to the field of predictive maintenance to highlight the challenges faced in the area, both for implementation and use-case. We conclude by pointing out that predictive maintenance is a hot topic in the context of Industry 4.0 but with several challenges to be better investigated in the area of machine learning and the application of reasoning.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) tsunami, public embracement, and the ubiquitous adoption of smart devices are affecting virtually every industry, directly or indirectly. The success of the current and future landscape of IoT and connected devices requires service provision characterized by scalability, ubiquity, reliability, and high-performance, among others. In order to achieve this attribution, the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing (CC), known as cloud IoT, has emerged as a new paradigm providing advanced services specific to aggregating, storing, and processing data generated by IoT. While the convergence of IoT and Cloud brings opportunities, it suffers from specific limitations such as bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The increasing need for supporting interaction between cloud and IoT led to Edge and Fog Computing (FC) in which computing and storage resources are located not only in the cloud but also at the edges near the source of data. The hierarchical and collaborative edge-fog-cloud architecture brings tremendous benefits as it enables us to distribute the intelligence and computation - including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and big data analytics - to achieve an optimal solution while satisfying the given constraints e.g., delay-energy tradeoff. Due to the hierarchical, cross-layer, and distributed nature of this model, achieving an osmotic and effective convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud computing requires overcoming many challenges with respect to design and implementation, as well as deployment and evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm by providing a blend of discussions on all important aspects of the underlying technologies to offer opportunities for more holistic studies and to accelerate knowledge acquisition. To gain a deep understanding of edge-fog-cloud, we will begin this paper by providing an in-depth tutorial and presenting the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, building blocks, components, protocols, applications, and other similar computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Following this, a holistic reference architecture for edge-fog-cloud IoT is presented and the major corresponding design and deployment considerations (e.g., service models, infrastructure design, provisioning, resource allocation, offloading, service migration, performance evaluation, and security concerns) are discussed. Next, we will take a look at the role of privacy-preserving, distributed, and collaborative analytics as well as the interaction between edge, fog, and cloud computing. Finally, we will overview the main challenges in the field of edge-fog-cloud computing that need to be tackled to realize the full potential of IoT. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Weeds are among the major threats to cotton production. Overreliance on herbicides for weed control has accelerated the evolution of herbicide-resistance in weeds and caused increasing concerns about environments, food safety and human health. Machine vision systems for automated/robotic weeding have received growing interest towards the realization of integrated, sustainable weed management. However, in the presence of unstructured field environments and significant biological variability of weeds, it remains a serious challenge to develop reliable weed identification and detection systems. A promising solution to address this challenge are the development of arge-scale, annotated image datasets of weeds specific to cropping systems and data-driven AI (artificial intelligence) models for weed detection. Among various deep learning architectures, a diversity of YOLO (You Only Look Once) detectors is well-suited for real-time application and has enjoyed great popularity for generic object detection. This study presents a new dataset (CottoWeedDet12) of weeds important to cotton production in the southern United States (U.S.); it consists of 5648 images of 12 weed classes with a total of 9370 bounding box annotations, collected under natural light conditions and at varied weed growth stages in cotton fields. A novel, comprehensive benchmark of 25 state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors of seven versions including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Scaled-YOLOv4, YOLOR and YOLOv5, YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, has been established for weed detection on the dataset. Evaluated through the Monte-Caro cross validation with 5 replications, the detection accuracy in terms of mAP@0.5 ranged from 88.14 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 95.22 % by YOLOv4, and the accuracy in terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95] ranged from 68.18 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 89.72 % by Scaled-YOLOv4. All the YOLO models especially YOLOv5n and YOLOv5s have shown great potential for real-time weed detection, and data augmentation could increase weed detection accuracy. Both the weed detection dataset2 and software program codes for model benchmarking in this study are publicly available3, which will be to be valuable resources for promoting future research on big data and AI-empowered weed detection and control for cotton and potentially other crops.

AB Background Banana (Musa spp.) is the most popular marketable fruit crop grown all over the world, and a dominant staple food in many developing countries. Worldwide, banana production is affected by numerous diseases and pests. Novel and rapid methods for the timely detection of pests and diseases will allow to surveil and develop control measures with greater efficiency. As deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and transfer learning has been successfully applied in various fields, it has freshly moved in the domain of just-in-time crop disease detection. The aim of this research is to develop an AI-based banana disease and pest detection system using a DCNN to support banana farmers. Results Large datasets of expert pre-screened banana disease and pest symptom/damage images were collected from various hotspots in Africa and Southern India. To build a detection model, we retrained three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using a transfer learning approach. A total of six different models were developed from 18 different classes (disease by plant parts) using images collected from different parts of the banana plant. Our studies revealed ResNet50 and InceptionV2 based models performed better compared to MobileNetV1. These architectures represent the state-of-the-art results of banana diseases and pest detection with an accuracy of more than 90% in most of the models tested. These experimental results were comparable with other state-of-the-art models found in the literature. With a future view to run these detection capabilities on a mobile device, we evaluated the performance of SSD (single shot detector) MobileNetV1. Performance and validation metrics were also computed to measure the accuracy of different models in automated disease detection methods. Conclusion Our results showed that the DCNN was a robust and easily deployable strategy for digital banana disease and pest detection. Using a pre-trained disease recognition model, we were able to perform deep transfer learning (DTL) to produce a network that can make accurate predictions. This significant high success rate makes the model a useful early disease and pest detection tool, and this research could be further extended to develop a fully automated mobile app to help millions of banana farmers in developing countries.

AB Nowadays, 5G is in its initial phase of commercialization. The 5G network will revolutionize the existing wireless network with its enhanced capabilities and novel features. 5G New Radio (5G NR), referred to as the global standardization of 5G, is presently under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and can be operable over the wide range of frequency bands from less than 6GHz to mmWave (100GHz). 3GPP mainly focuses on the three major use cases of 5G NR that are comprised of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (uRLLC), Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). For meeting the targets of 5G NR, multiple features like scalable numerology, flexible spectrum, forward compatibility, and ultra-lean design are added as compared to the LTE systems. This paper presents a brief overview of the added features and key performance indicators of 5G NR. The issues related to the adaptation of higher modulation schemes and inter-RAT handover synchronization are well addressed in this paper. With the consideration of these challenges, a next-generation wireless communication architecture is proposed. The architecture acts as the platform for migration towards beyond 5G/6G networks. Along with this, various technologies and applications of 6G networks are also overviewed in this paper. 6G network will incorporate Artificial intelligence (AI) based services, edge computing, quantum computing, optical wireless communication, hybrid access, and tactile services. For enabling these diverse services, a virtualized network slicing based architecture of 6G is proposed. Various ongoing projects on 6G and its technologies are also listed in this paper.

AB The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) on the advancement of the healthcare industry is immense. The ushering of the Medicine 4.0 has resulted in an increased effort to develop platforms, both at the hardware level as well as the underlying software level. This vision has led to the development of Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) systems. The basic enabling technologies include the communication systems between the sensing nodes and the processors; and the processing algorithms for generating an output from the data collected by the sensors. However, at present, these enabling technologies are also supported by several new technologies. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the H-IoT systems at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is bringing the computing power close to the deployed network and hence mitigating many challenges in the process. While the big data allows handling an enormous amount of data. Additionally, the Software Defined Networks (SDNs) bring flexibility to the system while the blockchains are finding the most novel use cases in H-IoT systems. The Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and Tactile Internet (TI) are driving the innovation in the H-IoT applications. This paper delves into the ways these technologies are transforming the H-IoT systems and also identifies the future course for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) using these new technologies.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging respiratory infectious disease, also known as coronavirus 2019. It appears in November 2019 in Hubei province (in China), and more specifically in the city of Wuhan, then spreads in the whole world. As the number of cases increases with unprecedented speed, many parts of the world are facing a shortage of resources and testing. Faced with this problem, physicians, scientists and engineers, including specialists in Artificial Intelligence (AI), have encouraged the development of a Deep Learning model to help healthcare professionals to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images and to determine the severity of the infection in a very short time, with low cost. In this paper, we propose CVDNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify COVID-19 infection from normal and other pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images. The proposed architecture is based on the residual neural network and it is constructed by using two parallel levels with different kernel sizes to capture local and global features of the inputs. This model is trained on a dataset publically available containing a combination of 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal and 1345 viral pneumonia chest x-ray images. The experimental results reveal that our CVDNet. These results represent a promising classification performance on a small dataset which can be further achieve better results with more training data. Overall, our CVDNet model can be an interesting tool to help radiologists in the diagnosis and early detection of COVID-19 cases. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   FRAMEWORK
AB The advent of Deep Learning (DL) is poised to dramatically change the delivery of healthcare in the near future. Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs.
   A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging.

AB Industry 4.0 is all about doing things in a concurrent, secure, and fine-grained manner. Internet of Things edge sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today's industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) damages the industry owners' money and loss of operators' lives. The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edge servers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which, in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional public-key infrastructure-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end, which largely motivates us to institute a blockchain and artificial intelligence-aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of this article include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boosts trust among collaborators and ensures an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance. The respective experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the other competing systems and models.

AB Herein, we focus on convergent 6G communication, localization and sensing systems by identifying key technology enablers, discussing their underlying challenges, implementation issues, and recommending potential solutions. Moreover, we discuss exciting new opportunities for integrated localization and sensing applications, which will disrupt traditional design principles and revolutionize the way we live, interact with our environment, and do business. Regarding potential enabling technologies, 6G will continue to develop towards even higher frequency ranges, wider bandwidths, and massive antenna arrays. In turn, this will enable sensing solutions with very fine range, Doppler, and angular resolutions, as well as localization to cm-level degree of accuracy. Besides, new materials, device types, and reconfigurable surfaces will allow network operators to reshape and control the electromagnetic response of the environment. At the same time, machine learning and artificial intelligence will leverage the unprecedented availability of data and computing resources to tackle the biggest and hardest problems in wireless communication systems. As a result, 6G will be truly intelligent wireless systems that will provide not only ubiquitous communication but also empower high accuracy localization and high-resolution sensing services. They will become the catalyst for this revolution by bringing about a unique new set of features and service capabilities, where localization and sensing will coexist with communication, continuously sharing the available resources in time, frequency, and space. This work concludes by highlighting foundational research challenges, as well as implications and opportunities related to privacy, security, and trust.

AB Oil production estimation plays a critical role in economic plans for local governments and organizations. Therefore, many studies applied different Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods to estimate oil production in different countries. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is a well-known model that has been successfully employed in various applications, including time-series forecasting. However, the ANFIS model faces critical shortcomings in its parameters during the configuration process. From this point, this paper works to solve the drawbacks of the ANFIS by optimizing ANFIS parameters using a modified Aquila Optimizer (AO) with the Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) technique. The main idea of the developed model, AOOBL-ANFIS, is to enhance the search process of the AO and use the AOOBL to boost the performance of the ANFIS. The proposed model is evaluated using real-world oil production datasets collected from different oilfields using several performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), Standard Deviation (Std), and computational time. Moreover, the AOOBL-ANFIS model is compared to several modified ANFIS models include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-ANFIS, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)-ANFIS, Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)-ANFIS, Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA)-ANFIS, and Genetic Algorithm (GA)-ANFIS, respectively. Additionally, it is compared to well-known time series forecasting methods, namely, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and Neural Network (NN). The outcomes verified the high performance of the AOOBL-ANFIS, which outperformed the classic ANFIS model and the compared models.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is an effective means to realize solar energy utilization. Due to the natural characteristics of random fluctuations in solar energy, the applications of PV power such as grid-connected PV power plant, distributed PVs, and building integrated PVs will introduce new characteristics to the generation and load side of the power grid. Therefore, accurate day-ahead PV power forecasting is of great significance for enabling grid manager to achieve PV power output data in advance and mitigate the influence of random fluctuations. To tackle the deficiencies of conventional artificial intelligence (AI) modeling methods such as overfitting problem and insufficient generalization ability to complex nonlinear modeling, a day-ahead PV power forecasting model assembled by fusing deep learning modeling and time correlation principles under a partial daily pattern prediction (PDPP) framework is proposed. First, an independent day-ahead PV power forecasting model based on long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) is established. Second, a modification method is proposed to update the forecasting results of LSTM-RNN model based on time correlation principles regarding different patterns of PV power in the forecasting day. Third, a partial daily pattern prediction (PDPP) framework is proposed to provide accurate daily pattern prediction information of particular days, which is used to guide the modification parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed forecasting method with time correlation modification (TCM) is more accurate than the individual LSTM-RNN model, and the performance of the forecasting model can be further improved for those days with accurate daily pattern predictions under the proposed PDPP framework.

AB The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.

AB Digital twins are the most important parts of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), and play a crucial role in the realization of the Metaverse. Therefore, two important factors: flexibility and adaptability, need to be focused on digital twinning systems. From a virtual perspective, constructing buildings, structures, and mechanisms in the Metaverse requires digital materials and components. Hence, accurate and reliable digital models can guarantee the success of implementation, particularly when it comes to completing physical twins in the real world. Accordingly, four Machine Learning (ML) methods to make digital twins of an advanced 42SiCr alloy considering all of its uncertainties and non-linearities have been employed in this paper. These ML methods accelerate the digitalization of the proposed alloy and allow users to employ them for a wide range of similar metals. Based on this technique, producers can borrow these virtual materials and build their structures in the Metaverse. This way, if the properties of the materials were satisfactory, they might buy them and start manufacturing their products. As a case study, we focus on digital twining of an 42SiCr steel with some influential factors in its mechanical properties, making the nature of the alloy complex. Processes, including heat treatment, may restore the material's deformability; however, Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) not only eliminates the impact of cold forming but also provides advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) properties. In this research, the combined impacts of different Q&P treatments were investigated on the mechanical properties of 42SiCr steel alloy. The results have shown the acceptability and accuracy of the proposed ML methods in realizing the digital twins of this complex alloy.

AB Currently, most mask extraction techniques are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there are still numerous problems that mask extraction techniques need to solve. Thus, the most advanced methods to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are necessary. The use of cooperative agents in mask extraction increases the efficiency of automatic image segmentation. Hence, we introduce a new mask extraction method that is based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the long-term manual mask extraction and to enhance medical image segmentation frameworks. A DRL-based method is introduced to deal with mask extraction issues. This new method utilizes a modified version of the Deep Q-Network to enable the mask detector to select masks from the image studied. Based on COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) images, we used DRL mask extraction-based techniques to extract visual features of COVID-19 infected areas and provide an accurate clinical diagnosis while optimizing the pathogenic diagnostic test and saving time. We collected CT images of different cases (normal chest CT, pneumonia, typical viral cases, and cases of COVID-19). Experimental validation achieved a precision of 97.12% with a Dice of 80.81%, a sensitivity of 79.97%, a specificity of 99.48%, a precision of 85.21%, an F1 score of 83.01%, a structural metric of 84.38%, and a mean absolute error of 0.86%. Additionally, the results of the visual segmentation clearly reflected the ground truth. The results reveal the proof of principle for using DRL to extract CT masks for an effective diagnosis of COVID-19.

AB Given the prevalence of depression worldwide and its major impact on society, several studies employed artificial intelligence modelling to automatically detect and assess depression. However, interpretation of these models and cues are rarely discussed in detail in the AI community, but have received increased attention lately. In this article, we aim to analyse the commonly selected features using a proposed framework of several feature selection methods and their effect on the classification results, which will provide an interpretation of the depression detection model. The developed framework aggregates and selects the most promising features for modelling depression detection from 38 feature selection algorithms of different categories. Using three real-world depression datasets, 902 behavioural cues were extracted from speech behaviour, speech prosody, eye movement and head pose. To verify the generalisability of the proposed framework, we applied the entire process to depression datasets individually and when combined. The results from the proposed framework showed that speech behaviour features (e.g. pauses) are the most distinctive features of the depression detection model. From the speech prosody modality, the strongest feature groups were F0, HNR, formants, and MFCC, while for the eye activity modality they were left-right eye movement and gaze direction, and for the head modality it was yaw head movement. Modelling depression detection using the selected features (even though there are only 9 features) outperformed using all features in all the individual and combined datasets. Our feature selection framework did not only provide an interpretation of the model, but was also able to produce a higher accuracy of depression detection with a small number of features in varied datasets. This could help to reduce the processing time needed to extract features and creating the model.

AB The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early December 2019 has caused immense damage to health and global well-being. Currently, there are approximately five million confirmed cases and the novel virus is still spreading rapidly all over the world. Many hospitals across the globe are not yet equipped with an adequate amount of testing kits and the manual Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is time-consuming and troublesome. It is hence very important to design an automated and early diagnosis system which can provide fast decision and greatly reduce the diagnosis error. The chest X-ray images along with emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, in particular Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have recently become a worthy choice for early COVID-19 screening. This paper proposes a DL assisted automated method using X-ray images for early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the effectiveness of eight pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such as AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, SqueezeNet, ResNet-34, ResNet-50 and Inception-V3 for classification of COVID-19 from normal cases. Also, comparative analyses have been made among these models by considering several important factors such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and type of optimizers with an aim to find the best suited model. The models have been validated on publicly available chest X-ray images and the best performance is obtained by ResNet-34 with an accuracy of 98.33%. This study will be useful for researchers to think for the design of more effective CNN based models for early COVID-19 detection.

AB Change detection based on remote sensing images plays an important role in the field of remote sensing analysis, and it has been widely used in many areas, such as resources monitoring, urban planning, disaster assessment, etc. In recent years, it has aroused widespread interest due to the explosive development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and change detection algorithms based on deep learning frameworks have made it possible to detect more delicate changes (such as the alteration of small buildings) with the help of huge amounts of remote sensing data, especially high-resolution (HR) data. Although there are many methods, we still lack a deep review of the recent progress concerning the latest deep learning methods in change detection. To this end, the main purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the available deep learning-based change detection algorithms using HR remote sensing images. The paper first describes the change detection framework and classifies the methods from the perspective of the deep network architectures adopted. Then, we review the latest progress in the application of deep learning in various granularity structures for change detection. Further, the paper provides a summary of HR datasets derived from different sensors, along with information related to change detection, for the potential use of researchers. Simultaneously, representative evaluation metrics for this task are investigated. Finally, a conclusion of the challenges for change detection using HR remote sensing images, which must be dealt with in order to improve the model's performance, is presented. In addition, we put forward promising directions for future research in this area.

AB The current industrial scenario has witnessed the application of several artificial intelligence-based technologies for mining and processing IoMT-based big data. An emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL), has been widely applied in IoMT-based systems as a measure to overcome the issues associated with incorporating AI into such lightweight distributed computing systems while tackling privacy issues as well. However, extensive research has identified that classical FL is still prone to privacy threats due to data leakage and the chances of adversarial attacks during gradient transfer operations. Inspired by these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework (Fed_select) that ensures user anonymity in IoMT-based environments for big data analysis under the FL scheme. Fed_Select utilizes alternative minimization to limit gradients and participants in system training to decrease points of system vulnerability. The framework works on an edge computing-based architecture which ensures user anonymity via the employment of hybrid encryption techniques along with added benefits of load reduction at the central server. Also, a Laplacian noise-based differential privacy is employed on the shared attributes for security enhancement that adds confidentiality to the transferred data even during adversarial scenarios. Experimental results on standard datasets showcase that the change in the volume of gradients shared and the number of participants is not proportional to the variation in various system performance parameters. Specifically, an idealistic range of client and gradient-sharing fractions along with the appropriate value of noise for differential privacy implementation is determined. Additionally, we analyze the system from a security perspective as well as compare it with other schemes.

AB As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.

AB The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (http://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.

AB In the era of development, the world is facing severe challenges, and environmental degradation is one of them. However, the globe has tried to introduce several initiatives to fight for environmental sustainability, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. The leading role of the proposed goals is to balance development and environmental anxiety. Therefore, to these issues, artificial intelligence and technological advancements play a vital role in the natural resource economy in the digital age. Policy analysts are always looking for solutions and have come up with several viable remedies to this problem. Consequently, information & communication technology (ICT) plays a significant role in sustainability in the digital era. However, under the theme of natural resource sustainability, the effectiveness of ICT has a significant impact on sustainability. Accordingly, the current study investigates the long-run effect of income per capita, tourism, natural resources rents, urbanization, and ICT on environmental sustainability in 36 OECD economies from 2000 to 2018. The current research employs an Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and two-step GMM to investigate the study's objectives. Results show the positive contribution of urbanization, natural resources, and tourism to CO2 emissions, while ICT reduces emissions. Besides, an inverted EKC curve is also validated for selected economies. In addition, the moderate effect of ICT on urbanization, natural resources, and tourism shows a significant decline in CO2 emissions. In light of the findings, this study recommends several crucial measures for environmental sustainability.

AB One of the worst environmental catastrophes that endanger the Australian community is wildfire. To lessen potential fire threats, it is helpful to recognize fire occurrence patterns and identify fire susceptibility in wildfire-prone regions. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms is acknowledged as one of the most well-known methods for addressing non-linear issues like wildfire hazards. It has always been difficult to analyze these multivariate environmental disas-ters because modeling can be infiuenced by a variety of sources of uncertainty, including the quantity and quality of training procedures and input variables. Moreover, although ML techniques show promise in this field, they are unsta-ble for a number of reasons, including the usage of irrelevant descriptor characteristics when developing the models. Explainable AI (XAI) can assist us in acquiring insights into these constraints and, consequently, modifying the model -ing approach and training data necessary. In this research, we describe how a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model can be utilized to interpret the results of a deep learning (DL) model that is developed for wildfire susceptibility prediction. Different contributing factors such as topographical, landcover/vegetation, and meteorological factors are fed into the model and various SHAP plots are used to identify which parameters are impacting the prediction model, their relative importance, and the reasoning behind specific decisions. The findings drawn from SHAP plots show the significant contributions made by factors such as humidity, wind speed, rainfall, elevation, slope, and normalized dif-ference moisture index (NDMI) to the suggested model's output for wildfire susceptibility mapping. We infer that de-veloping an explainable model would aid in comprehending the model's decision to map wildfire susceptibility, pinpoint high-contributing components in the prediction model, and consequently control fire hazards effectively.

AB To process and transfer large amounts of data in emerging wireless services, it has become increasingly appealing to exploit distributed data communication and learning. Specifically, edge learning (EL) enables local model training on geographically disperse edge nodes and minimizes the need for frequent data exchange. However, the current design of separating EL deployment and communication optimization does not yet reap the promised benefits of distributed signal processing, and sometimes suffers from excessive signalling overhead, long processing delay, and unstable learning convergence. In this paper, we provide an overview on practical distributed EL techniques and their interplay with advanced communication optimization designs. In particular, typical performance metrics for dual-functional learning and communication networks are discussed. Also, recent achievements of enabling techniques for the dual-functional design are surveyed with exemplifications from the mutual perspectives of "communications for learning " and "learning for communications. " The application of EL techniques within a variety of future communication systems are also envisioned for beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks. For the application in goal-oriented semantic communication, we present a first mathematical model of the goal-oriented source entropy as an optimization problem. In addition, from the viewpoint of information theory, we identify fundamental open problems of characterizing rate regions for communication networks supporting distributed learning-and-computing tasks. We also present technical challenges as well as emerging application opportunities in this field, with the aim of inspiring future research and promoting widespread developments of EL in B5G.

AB A High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) is a network node that operates in the stratosphere at an of altitude around 20 km and is instrumental for providing communication services. Precipitated by technological innovations in the areas of autonomous avionics, array antennas, solar panel efficiency levels, and battery energy densities, and fueled by flourishing industry ecosystems, the HAPS has emerged as an indispensable component of next-generations of wireless networks. In this article, we provide a vision and framework for the HAPS networks of the future supported by a comprehensive and state-of-the-art literature review. We highlight the unrealized potential of HAPS systems and elaborate on their unique ability to serve metropolitan areas. The latest advancements and promising technologies in the HAPS energy and payload systems are discussed. The integration of the emerging Reconfigurable Smart Surface (RSS) technology in the communications payload of HAPS systems for providing a cost-effective deployment is proposed. A detailed overview of the radio resource management in HAPS systems is presented along with synergistic physical layer techniques, including Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. Numerous aspects of handoff management in HAPS systems are described. The notable contributions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in HAPS, including machine learning in the design, topology management, handoff, and resource allocation aspects are emphasized. The extensive overview of the literature we provide is crucial for substantiating our vision that depicts the expected deployment opportunities and challenges in the next 10 years (next-generation networks), as well as in the subsequent 10 years (next-next-generation networks).

AB Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the "softwarization" of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.

AB The purpose of our systematic review was to inspect the recently published research on Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) and harmonize the assimilations it articulates on remote big data management tools, sensing and computing technologies, and visual perception and environment mapping algorithms. The research problems were whether robotic manufacturing processes and industrial wireless sensor networks shape IoRT and lead to improved product quality by use of remote big data management tools, whether IoRT devices communicate autonomously regarding event modeling and forecasting by leveraging machine learning and clustering algorithms, sensing and computing technologies, and image processing tools, and whether smart connected objects, situational awareness algorithms, and edge computing technologies configure IoRT systems and cloud robotics in relation to distributed task coordination through visual perception and environment mapping algorithms. A Shiny app was harnessed for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to configure the flow diagram integrating evidence-based gathered and processed data (the search outcomes and screening procedures). A quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases was carried out throughout June and October 2022, with search terms including "Internet of Robotic Things" + "remote big data management tools", "sensing and computing technologies", and "visual perception and environment mapping algorithms". Artificial intelligence and intelligent workflows by use of AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews), Dedoose, DistillerSR, and SRDR (Systematic Review Data Repository) have been deployed as data extraction tools for literature collection, screening, and evaluation, for document flow monitoring, for inspecting qualitative and mixed methods research, and for establishing robust outcomes and correlations. For bibliometric mapping by use of data visualization, Dimensions AI was leveraged and with regards to layout algorithms, VOSviewer was harnessed.

TI An in silico deep learning approach to multi-epitope vaccine design: a

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID WEB SERVER; PROTEIN; PREDICTION; TOOL
AB The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world. Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus.

AB Socially shared regulation contributes to the success of collaborative learning. However, the assessment of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) faces several challenges in the effort to increase the understanding of collaborative learning and support outcomes due to the unobservability of the related cognitive and emotional processes. The recent development of trace-based assessment has enabled innovative opportunities to overcome the problem. Despite the potential of a trace-based approach to study SSRL, there remains a paucity of evidence on how trace-based evidence could be captured and utilised to assess and promote SSRL. This study aims to investigate the assessment of electrodermal activities (EDA) data to understand and support SSRL in collaborative learning, hence enhancing learning outcomes. The data collection involves secondary school students (N = 94) working collaboratively in groups through five science lessons. A multimodal data set of EDA and video data were examined to assess the relationship among shared arousals and interactions for SSRL. The results of this study inform the patterns among students' physiological activities and their SSRL interactions to provide trace-based evidence for an adaptive and maladaptive pattern of collaborative learning. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence about how trace-based data could be utilised to predict learning outcomes in collaborative learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Socially shared regulation has been recognised as an essential aspect of collaborative learning success.It is challenging to make the processes of learning regulation 'visible' to better understand and support student learning, especially in dynamic collaborative settings.Multimodal learning analytics are showing promise for being a powerful tool to reveal new insights into the temporal and sequential aspects of regulation in collaborative learning.What this paper adds Utilising multimodal big data analytics to reveal the regulatory patterns of shared physiological arousal events (SPAEs) and regulatory activities in collaborative learning.Providing evidence of using multimodal data including physiological signals to indicate trigger events in socially shared regulation.Examining the differences of regulatory patterns between successful and less successful collaborative learning sessions.Demonstrating the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict collaborative learning success by examining regulatory patterns.Implications for practice and/or policy Our findings offer insights into how students regulate their learning during collaborative learning, which can be used to design adaptive supports that can foster students' learning regulation.This study could encourage researchers and practitioners to consider the methodological development incorporating advanced techniques such as AI machine learning for capturing, processing and analysing multimodal data to examine and support learning regulation.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is favoring digital transitions in many industries and in society as a whole. Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to describe the digital solutions that have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19-related literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas.
   Results: The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement.
   Conclusions: In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years.

AB This research presents a new model for finding optimal conditions in the concrete technology area. To do that, results of a series of laboratory investigations on concrete samples were considered and used to design several artificial intelligence (AI) models. The data samples include 8 parameters i.e., silica fume replacement ratio, fly ash replacement ratio, fine aggregate, water content, high rate water reducing agent, coarse aggregate, total cementitious material, and age of samples, were used to predict and optimize the compressive strength of concrete samples. For optimization purposes, this study used a human learning optimization (HLO) algorithm to find the optimal results as well as optimizing the kernel coefficients of the support vector regression (SVR) models. Initially, to form the core of this research, various models were constructed and proposed to design the required relationship between the data using SVR. Since different SVR kernels have their own coefficients, using optimization theory, the probability of error in the models was reduced and the models were identified and executed with the highest accuracy. Finally, the polynomial model was selected as the model with the lowest computational error and the highest accuracy for evaluating the compressive strength of the concrete samples. The accuracy of the proposed SVR model for training and testing data was obtained as the coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.9694 and R-2 = 0.9470, respectively. This function was considered as a relation, to be developed by the HLO algorithm to find optimal options under different conditions. The results for 14 samples, which are the most important examples of this research, showed that the optimal states are obtained with a high level of accuracy. This confirms the proper use/develop of the SVR-HLO algorithm in designing the predictive model as well as finding optimal conditions in the concrete technology area.

AB Domain-specific hardware is becoming a promising topic in the backdrop of improvement slow down for general-purpose processors due to the foreseeable end of Moore's Law. Machine learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has become the most dazzling domain witnessing successful applications in a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. The incomparable accuracy of DNNs is achieved by paying the cost of hungry memory consumption and high computational complexity, which greatly impedes their deployment in embedded systems. Therefore, the DNN compression concept was naturally proposed and widely used for memory saving and compute acceleration. In the past few years, a tremendous number of compression techniques have sprung up to pursue a satisfactory tradeoff between processing efficiency and application accuracy. Recently, this wave has spread to the design of neural network accelerators for gaining extremely high performance. However, the amount of related works is incredibly huge and the reported approaches are quite divergent. This research chaos motivates us to provide a comprehensive survey on the recent advances toward the goal of efficient compression and execution of DNNs without significantly compromising accuracy, involving both the high-level algorithms and their applications in hardware design. In this article, we review the mainstream compression approaches such as compact model, tensor decomposition, data quantization, and network sparsification. We explain their compression principles, evaluation metrics, sensitivity analysis, and joint-way use. Then, we answer the question of how to leverage these methods in the design of neural network accelerators and present the state-of-the-art hardware architectures. In the end, we discuss several existing issues such as fair comparison, testing workloads, automatic compression, influence on security, and framework/hardware-level support, and give promising topics in this field and the possible challenges as well. This article attempts to enable readers to quickly build up a big picture of neural network compression and acceleration, clearly evaluate various methods, and confidently get started in the right way.

AB Recently, smart cities, healthcare system, and smart vehicles have raised challenges on the capability and connectivity of state-of-the-art Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, especially for the devices in hotspots area. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.

AB Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.

AB The goal of managing smart cities and societies is to maximize the efficient use of finite resources while enhancing the quality of life. To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging de-velopments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the most commonly used ML method in the publications. According to research, the majority of papers are about smart cities' power and energy management. Furthermore, most papers have concentrated on improving only one parameter, where the accuracy parameter obtains the most attention. In addition, Python is the most frequently used language, which was used in 69.8% of the papers.

DE Adenoma Detection Rate; Adenoma Miss Rate; Computer-aided Detection;
   Deep Learning; Randomized Tandem Colonoscopy Study
AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) systems are intended to address the issue of missed polyps during colonoscopy. The effect of CADe during screening and surveillance colonoscopy has not previously been studied in a United States (U.S.) population.
   METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multi-center, single-blind randomized tandem colonoscopy study to evaluate a deep-learning based CADe system (EndoScreener, Shanghai Wision AI, China). Patients were enrolled across 4 U.S. academic medical centers from 2019 through 2020. Patients presenting for colorectal cancer screening or surveillance were randomized to CADe colonoscopy first or high-definition white light (HDWL) colonoscopy first, followed immediately by the other procedure in tandem fashion by the same endoscopist. The primary outcome was adenoma miss rate (AMR), and secondary outcomes included sessile serrated lesion (SSL) miss rate and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC).
   RESULTS: A total of 232 patients entered the study, with 116 patients randomized to undergo CADe colonoscopy first and 116 patients randomized to undergo HDWL colonoscopy first. After the exclusion of 9 patients, the study cohort included 223 patients. AMR was lower in the CADe-first group compared with the HDWL-first group (20.12% [34/169] vs 31.25% [45/144]; odds ratio [OR], 1.8048; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0780-3.0217; P=.0247). SSL miss rate was lower in the CADe-first group (7.14% [1/14]) vs the HDWL-first group (42.11% [8/19]; P=.0482). First-pass APC was higher in the CADe-first group (1.19 [standard deviation (SD), 2.03] vs 0.90 [SD, 1.55]; P=.0323). First-pass ADR was 50.44% in the CADe-first group and 43.64 % in the HDWL-first group (P=.3091).
   CONCLUSION: In this U.S. multicenter tandem colonoscopy randomized controlled trial, we demonstrate a decrease in AMR and SSL miss rate and an increase in first-pass APC with the use of a CADe-system when compared with HDWL colonoscopy alone.

AB In any aquatic system analysis, the modelling water quality parameters are of considerable significance. The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R-2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).

AB The recent explosion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in the breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (AM) process modeling, which is an indispensable step to derive the process-structure-property relationship. However, the success of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, hindering the direct applications of big-data based ML tools to metal AM problems. To fully exploit the power of machine learning for metal AM while alleviating the dependence on "big data", we put forth a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both data and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum, mass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of physics-informed deep learning to three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type approach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function, which can not only exactly enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process. The PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully assess the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available experimental data and high-fidelity simulation results, using finite element based variational multi-scale formulation method. The investigations show that the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM shows the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader applications to advanced manufacturing. All the data-sets and the PINN code will be made open-sourced in https://yan.cee.illinois.edu/ once the paper is published.

AB The upcoming fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks is expected to lay a foundation of intelligent networks with the provision of some isolated artificial intelligence (AI) operations. However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks. Subsequently, we propose a novel QC-assisted and QML-based framework for 6G communication networks while articulating its challenges and potential enabling technologies at the network infrastructure, network edge, air interface, and user end. Finally, some promising future research directions for the quantum-and QML-assisted B5G networks are identified and discussed.

AB Network slicing has been widely agreed as a promising technique to accommodate diverse services for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.

AB Background: The idea of smart healthcare has gradually gained attention as a result of the information technology industry's rapid development. Smart healthcare uses next-generation technologies i.e., artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), to intelligently transform current medical methods to make them more efficient, dependable and individualized. One of the most prominent uses of telemedicine and e-health in medical image analysis is teledermatology. Telecommunications technologies are used in this industry to send medical information to professionals. Teledermatology is a useful method for the identification of skin lesions, particularly in rural locations, because the skin is visually perceptible. One of the most recent tools for diagnosing skin cancer is dermoscopy. To classify skin malignancies, numerous computational approaches have been proposed in the literature. However, difficulties still exist i.e., lesions with low contrast, imbalanced datasets, high level of memory complexity, and the extraction of redundant features.Methods: In this work, a unified CAD model is proposed based on a deep learning framework for skin lesion segmentation and classification. In the proposed approach, the source dermoscopic images are initially pre-processed using a contrast enhancement based modified bio-inspired multiple exposure fusion approach. In the second stage, a custom 26-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is designed to segment the skin lesion regions. In the third stage, four pre-trained CNN models (Xception, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and VGG16) are modified and trained using transfer learning on the segmented lesion images. In the fourth stage, the deep features vectors are extracted from all the CNN models and fused using the convolutional sparse image decomposition fusion approach. In the fifth stage, the univariate measurement and Poisson distribution feature selection approach is used for the best features selection for classification. Finally, the selected features are fed to the multi-class support vector machine (MC-SVM) for the final classification.Results: The proposed approach employed to the HAM10000, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and PH2 datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.57%, 98.62%, 93.47%, and 98.98% respectively which are better than previous works.Conclusion: When compared to renowned state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that the proposed skin lesion detection and classification approach achieved higher performance in terms of both visually and enhanced quantitative evaluation with enhanced accuracy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Pneumonia is a microorganism infection that causes chronic inflammation of the human lung cells. Chest X-ray imaging is the most well-known screening approach used for detecting pneumonia in the early stages. While chest-Xray images are mostly blurry with low illumination, a strong feature extraction approach is required for promising identification performance. Objectives: A new hybrid explainable deep learning framework is proposed for accurate pneumonia disease identification using chest X-ray images.Methods: The proposed hybrid workflow is developed by fusing the capabilities of both ensemble convo-lutional networks and the Transformer Encoder mechanism. The ensemble learning backbone is used to extract strong features from the raw input X-ray images in two different scenarios: ensemble A (i.e., DenseNet201, VGG16, and GoogleNet) and ensemble B (i.e., DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception). Whereas, the Transformer Encoder is built based on the self-attention mechanism with mul-tilayer perceptron (MLP) for accurate disease identification. The visual explainable saliency maps are derived to emphasize the crucial predicted regions on the input X-ray images. The end-to-end training process of the proposed deep learning models over all scenarios is performed for binary and multi -class classification scenarios.Results: The proposed hybrid deep learning model recorded 99.21% classification performance in terms of overall accuracy and F1-score for the binary classification task, while it achieved 98.19% accuracy and 97.29% F1-score for multi-classification task. For the ensemble binary identification scenario, ensemble A recorded 97.22% accuracy and 97.14% F1-score, while ensemble B achieved 96.44% for both accuracy and F1-score. For the ensemble multiclass identification scenario, ensemble A recorded 97.2% accuracy and 95.8% F1-score, while ensemble B recorded 96.4% accuracy and 94.9% F1-score.Conclusion: The proposed hybrid deep learning framework could provide promising and encouraging explainable identification performance comparing with the individual, ensemble models, or even the lat-est AI models in the literature.

AB While Industry 4.0 has been trending in practice and research, operations management studies in this area remain nascent. Our intent is to understand the current state of research in Industry 4.0 in different disciplines and deduce insights and opportunities for future research in operations management. In this paper, we provide a focused analysis to examine the state-of-the-art research in Industry 4.0. To learn about researchers' perspectives about Industry 4.0, we conducted a large-scale, cross-disciplinary and global survey on Industry 4.0 topics among researchers in industrial engineering, operations management, operations research, control and data science at the 9th IFAC MIM 2019 Conference in Berlin in August 2019. By using our survey findings and literature analysis, we build structural and conceptual frameworks to understand the current state of knowledge and to propose future research opportunities for operations management scholars.

AB Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015-2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.

AB A 6-year-long high-resolution Chinese air quality reanalysis (CAQRA) dataset is presented in this study obtained from the assimilation of surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS).This dataset contains surface fields of six conventional air pollutants in China (i.e. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) for the period 2013-2018 at high spatial (15km +/- 15km) and temporal (1 h) resolutions. This paper aims to document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the assimilation system and the first validation results for the above reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV R 2 D 0 :52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE) D 0 :54 mg =m3 for CO, and CV RMSE D 16 :4-39.3 mu g =m(3) for the other pollutants on an hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2.5 reanalysis dataset is further validated against the independent datasets from the US Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R 2 D 0 :74-0.86 and RMSE D 16 :8-33.6 mu g =m3 in different cities). Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM2.5 concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2.5 reanalysis is higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting. All datasets are freely available at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00053 (Tang et al., 2020a), and a prototype product containing the monthly and annual means of the CAQRA dataset has also been released at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00092 (Tang et al., 2020b) to facilitate the evaluation of the CAQRA dataset by potential users.

AB Foreword The only time is now. Every "now" is unique. Responsible persons ask themselves, "How can I act well now?" The answers will differ for every person, because just as every situation is unique, so is every person different from every other person. But surely there must be some algorithm that will assist us in coming to the right answer. Unfortunately, no, for there is no right answer. There is only an answer that is as appropriate as we can conclude at that moment in that situation. No written guidelines can apply appropriately to every unique situation. Unfortunately we physicians have been suckled on a fallacy: "What's good for the goose is good for the gander." Phrased in medical terms, "normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad." This is too simple, and often wrong. Good clinicians know that care must be personalized for it to be optimal. So-called normal findings give rough guidance, sometimes applicable to groups, but frequently wrong for individuals. Consider intraocular pressure (IOP). A normal IOP of 15 mmHg good for some and bad for others, and an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg is good for some and bad for others. We are so bombarded by the myth of the sanctity of the standard distribution curve that it is hard to think independently and specifically. Also, unfortunately, doctors are prone to decide for patients, often on the basis of normative data that is not relevant or important for the particular patient. That we do this is not surprising, as we want to help, and so we default to what seems to be the easy, safe (non-thinking) way, in which we do not have to hold ourselves accountable for the outcome. Somebody HAS to decide, or else we would be living in an anarchical world. Also true. And because none of us knows as much as we need to know to act appropriately, we seek advice from so-called "experts." For us to care for people well it is essential that we consider what others recommend. So we look to experts, as we should. However, experts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Remember that von Graefe in 1860 recommended surgical iridectomy for all glaucoma, Elliot recommended mustard plaster between the shoulders for glaucoma, Becker based treatment on tonographic findings, Weve reported 100% success with penetrating cyclodiathermy in glaucoma, Lichter advised against laser trabeculoplasty, many thought Cypass was great, and the investigators in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study indicated that an IOP usually around 12 mmHg was better than one usually around 20 mmHg. All wrong. What the authors of these guidelines have done excellently, is to provide a general framework on which ophthalmologists can hang pieces of evidence, so as to be able to evaluate the validity and the importance of that evidence. In doing this meticulously they have provided a valuable service to all ophthalmologists, none of whom individually have either the time or the skill to be fully informed. In their own practices the authors consider whether valid information is relevant for the particular person being considered. That process of considering relevance is essential, always. And relevance is based on the particular unique patient, unique doctor and unique situation. The only guideline the authors can provide in this regard is to remind us all to consider relevance with all patients in all situations, and from the patient's perspective. Even more important than the service to ophthalmologists is the benefit to patients that will result from thoughtful use of these guidelines.
   We need, also, to remember that diagnoses are generic, and that within every diagnosis there are differences. For example what does a diagnosis of primary open angle mean? Some of those affected will rapidly go blind despite the most thoughtful treatment and others will keep their sight even without treatment. What does a diagnosis of Chandler's Syndrome mean? In some, surgery works well, and, in others, poorly. So one never directs diagnosis and treatment at a condition, but rather at the person, the objective being the wellness of that person. The previous European Glaucoma Society Guidelines are used internationally. It is good that the EGS is again providing updated, useful information.The Guidelines are a practical, inspirational contribution. George L. Spaeth, BA, MD.
